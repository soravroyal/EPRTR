  <phrase groupIdtip="2">Greenhouse gases are those gaseous constituents of the atmosphere, both natural and anthropogenic that tend to trap heat radiating from the Earth's surface, thus causing warming in the lower atmosphere, which is considered to lead to climate change. This property causes the greenhouse effect. Water vapour (H<sub>2</sub>O), carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) are the primary greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere. Moreover there are a number of entirely human-made greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>).</phrase>

InsertUpdate|Static|HomeWelcomeText|en-GB|The <em>European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR)</em> is the Europe-wide register that provides easily accessible key environmental data from industrial facilities in European Union Member States and in Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Serbia and Switzerland. It replaced and improved upon the previous European Pollutant Emission Register (EPER).</br>The new register contains data reported annually by more than&nbsp;<em>30,000 industrial facilities</em> covering 65 economic activities across Europe.</br>For each facility, information is provided concerning the amounts of pollutant releases to air, water and land as well as off-site transfers of waste and of pollutants in waste water from a list of 91 key pollutants including heavy metals, pesticides, greenhouse gases and dioxins <em>for years 2007 onwards</em>. Some information on releases from diffuse sources is also available and will be gradually enhanced.</br>The register contributes to <em>transparency and public participation in environmental decision-making</em>.

E-PRTR does not assess facilities' compliance with these permitting conditions. Exceedance of the E-PRTR annual emission threshold values does not mean that the facilities are not compliant with their permit conditions. Requests for information on compliance issues should be addressed to the Member States' competent authorities.</p>"}

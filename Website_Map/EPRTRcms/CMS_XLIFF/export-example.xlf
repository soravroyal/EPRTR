<h2><span style="color: #993300;">The E-PRTR Data</span></h2>
<p><strong><a name="a1"></a>1.&nbsp;Which industrial facilities are included in the E-PRTR?</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The Rio Declaration in 1992 gave impetus to the idea of setting up emission inventories as tools for providing information on pollutants to the public. In the EU, this idea was first given concrete form in 1996 through the Directive concerning <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:024:0008:0029:en:PDF">Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC)</a> and in 2000 with the adoption of the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000D0479:EN:HTML">Commission Decision on the European Pollutant Emission Register (EPER).</a></p>
<p>In 1998 the <a href="http://www.unece.org/env/pp/">UN-ECE Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters</a> entered into force. Under the convention, a specific <strong><a href="http://www.unece.org/env/pp/prtr.htm">Protocol on Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers (PRTR)</a> </strong>was adopted at an extraordinary meeting of the Parties to the Aarhus Convention on 21 May 2003.</p>
<p>The aim of all these instruments was to develop tools which <strong>ensure a real participation of citizens in environmental matters </strong>by enhancing public access to environmental information.</p>
<p>In order to implement the <a href="http://www.unece.org/env/pp/prtr.htm">PRTR Protocol</a>, the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) was established through <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:033:0001:0017:EN:PDF">Regulation (EC) No 166/2006. E-PRTR</a> replaces the previous European Pollutant Emission Register (EPER).</p>
<p><a name="a2"></a><strong>2. What information can be found on E-PRTR?</strong></p>
<p>E-PRTR contains data on the main pollutant releases to air, water and land of about 24,000 industrial facilities across the European Union and EFTA countries. It also contains data on off-site transfers of wastewater and waste from these facilities.</p>
<p>These data represent the total annual emission releases during normal operations and accidents. Releases and transfers must be reported only if the emissions of a facility are above the activity and pollutant thresholds set out in the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:033:0001:0017:EN:PDF">E-PRTR Regulation</a>. Data have to be transmitted yearly by 30 March. The first year of reporting was 2007.</p>
<p>The total annual quantities are indicated for releases and transfers as well as accidental releases, if any.</p>
<p>The E-PRTR also contains information gathered under the previous emission register EPER for the reporting years 2001 and 2004 (the EPER reporting cycle was once every three years).</p>
<p>In the E-PRTR register users will also find information on a number of releases from diffuse sources available as map layers.</p>
<p><strong><a name="a3">3. Who benefits from E-PRTR?</a></strong></p>
<p>Everyone benefits from the register.</p>
<p>Users are given access to emission releases of industrial facilities in their neighbourhood or country, which can be compared with other facilities all over Europe. Access is also given to the emission trends over the years.</p>
<p>Such access to data empowers European citizens with important information on environmental and health protection, and be forthcoming on how to reduce these emission releases. The register gives companies the opportunity to provide information to the public and show that they are environmentally pro-active while monitoring the pollution records of their sector.</p>
<p>E-PRTR also aims at providing governments, competent authorities, policymakers and scientists with a coherent and Europe-wide emission release database.</p>
<p><strong>4. Which industrial facilities are included in the E-PRTR?</strong></p>
<p>E-PRTR covers large and medium-sized industrial facilities operating in 65 activities within 9 groups: energy; production and processing of metals; mineral industry; chemical industry; waste and waste water management; paper and wood production and processing; intensive livestock production and aquaculture; animal and vegetable products from the food and beverage sector and other activities (<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:033:0001:0017:EN:PDF">Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 166/2006</a>)</span>. All off-site transfers of hazardous waste of over 2 tons a year and non-hazardous waste transfer over 2,000 tons a year must be reported. (<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:033:0001:0017:EN:PDF">Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 166/2006</a></span>).</p>
<p>E-PRTR includes installations that fall within the scope of the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:024:0008:0029:en:PDF">IPPC Directive</a> (currently Directive 2008/1/EC) and the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:275:0032:0046:EN:PDF">ETS Directive</a> (Directive 2003/87/EC), as well as other plants.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5. What share of total EU emission releases does the E-PRTR cover?</strong></p>
<p>The pollutant reporting thresholds cover about 90% of the total mass emission from E-PRTR regulated industrial sources of specified pollutants.</p>
<p>Several studies have been conducted on the previous pollutants register EPER to assess the share of its emission data. Comparison with total EU emission releases of some important greenhouse gases and air pollutants (as reported under the <a href="http://unfccc.int/2860.php">UN Framework Convention on Climate Change</a> and the <a href="http://www.unece.org/env/lrtap/">UNECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution</a>) shows that EPER covered around 42% of total EU carbon dioxide (CO2) emission releases; 15% of total EU methane (CH4) emission releases; 13% of total EU nitrous oxide (N2O) emission releases; 6% of total EU-15 non-methane volatile organic carbon (NMVOC) releases; 26% of total EU nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission releases and 70% of total EU sulphur oxides (SOx) emission releases (2004 data).</p>
<p>This exercise will be carried out again for E-PRTR data. It is expected that all the proportions will rise due to the larger coverage (more sectors) of E-PRTR compared to EPER.</p>
<p><strong>6. Are E-PRTR and EPER data complete and comparable?</strong></p>
<p>The Commission strives to achieve the highest possible degree of completeness and comparability when collecting and processing E-PRTR data . E-PRTR covers data reported by many countries and collected from a wide range of sectors of activity and more than 24,000 individual sources of data. This invariably puts some boundaries on the completeness and comparability of the data.</p>
<p>The first E-PRTR collection of data required considerable efforts from all parties involved (operators; competent authorities; Commission, EEA) to prevent and correct errors and omissions.</p>
<p>The E-PRTR data on total annual releases and transfers do not provide for direct comparisons of individual facilities' environmental performance because large facilities with good environmental performance can have higher annual releases than much smaller facilities performing poorly. Between sectors, the variety of production processes and products manufactured has also to be considered when making comparisons.&nbsp; Under E-PRTR, no "activity data" (for instance on production volume or energy consumption) have to be reported by the facilities although such data can be voluntary provided by the operators as a way of putting in context the information on releases and transfers. In addition, different techniques are used to determine releases and transfers in different countries, thus creating differing levels of uncertainty. .The method used to determine releases and transfers is provided in the register to allow users to better compare data.</p>
<p>A technical review of the dataset is carried out by the European Environment Agency (EEA) and the European Topic Centres to support the Member States to assess the completeness and the comparability of the reported data.</p>
<p>Comparability of EPER and E-PRTR data is possible at facility level, whether the facility has reported under both regimes and the activity under the scope of EPER and E-PRTR has the same scope. Almost all the EPER pollutants correspond to the E-PRTR pollutants except for two groups of substances, mono aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, xylenes known as BTEX) that are reported as individual releases if the thresholds of BTEX is exceeded and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for EPER and E-PRTR are reported differently (EPER excludes emissions from biomass).</p>
<p><strong>7. How has the quality of E-PRTR data been checked?</strong></p>
<p>Operators which are subject to the E-PRTR Regulation are required to provide authorities with the best available data on their facilities' pollutant emission releases and transfers.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the reporting countries to check the accuracy of the emission releases data reported by the operators before submitting them to E-PRTR. For additional explanation on the quality control and assurance processes in each EU Member State, please see the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">E-PRTR guidance document</span> and the links to the existing national registers.</p>
<p>Member States, the Commission and the European Environment Agency (EEA) have checked that all the data submitted comply with the agreed reporting format through different automatic validation processes. The validation covers the type of pollutants; the codes for industrial sectors; the type of geographical coordinates; and the format of the data. Such a validation is required before data can be included in the E-PRTR register.</p>
<p>The first dataset referring to reporting year 2007 has been assessed and reviewed including comparison with data reported under the previous register EPER as well as a geographical check.</p>
<p><strong>8. How do I know whether the reported emission releases are dangerous?</strong></p>
<p>The E-PRTR website provides a summary description of the 91 pollutants covered, including their general impacts on human health and the environment. You will find this in the <strong>"<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Library</span>" </strong>option in the general menu.</p>
<p>It does not, however, indicate the risk to human health or the environment from the emission releases levels in a specific area at a specific point in time.</p>
<p>In line with European and national legislation, facilities covered by E-PRTR can only operate if they have obtained the appropriate permits which outline the conditions set by the competent authorities to protect human health and the environment. E-PRTR does not assess facilities' compliance with these permitting conditions. Exceedance of the E-PRTR annual emission threshold values does not necessarily mean that the facilities are not compliant with their permit conditions. Requests for information on compliance issues should be addressed to the Member State competent authorities.</p>
<p><strong>9. Is any information kept confidential?</strong></p>
<p>All PRTR data reported by operators appears on the website except for confidential data. Information that is classified confidential by the competent authorities according to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:033:0001:0017:EN:PDF">Article 11 of the E-PRTR Regulation</a></span> is not transmitted to the E-PRTR. The quantity of emission releases and transfers in waste water are always reported.</p>
<p><strong>10. Which facilities are shown on the maps?</strong></p>
<p>All facilities have to report their geographical co-ordinates, which are shown on the maps. However, if the coordinates are not correct, the facility may be located outside the EU.</p>
<p><strong>11. The general information delivered by the facilities sometimes varies. Why is this?</strong></p>
<p>E-PRTR includes some "voluntary" reporting related to production volumes; regulatory bodies; number of installations; number of operating hours and number of employees. Some facilities have reported this information while others have not.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h2>How the website is organised</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <pollutant_name>Methane</pollutant_name>
    <main_uses>As the major constituent of natural gas, methane is burned to directly heat homes and other commercial buildings. It is also used as a fuel in power stations to produce electricity. Methane is used widely in the chemical industry in the production of more complex chemical compounds.</main_uses>
    <main_methods_of_release>Methane occurs naturally in the environment. One of the major sources is from the decomposition of plant and animal matter by methane producing bacteria. These occur in air-less environments such as marshes and the gut of some animals and landfills. Methane is also trapped in pockets within the earth's crust, and can be released during the mining of fossil fuels. On a global scale, the human activities that result in the most methane emission, in descending order of importance are: livestock farming, production of fossil fuels, wet rice cultivation, biomass burning, landfill and domestic sewage. </main_methods_of_release>

    <pollutant_name>Carbon Dioxide</pollutant_name>
    <main_uses>Carbon dioxide has many uses, such as a coolant, fire extinguishing gas and preservative. The gas is also used to provide the bubbles in fizzy drinks. A minor use of the solid (frozen) form is to produce smoke effects in TV, film and theatre.</main_uses>
    <main_methods_of_release>Carbon dioxide is released in large quantities from natural processes, notably respiration by living organisms. Releases from respiration are balanced by a similar quantity taken up by photosynthesis. Other natural sources of carbon dioxide include volcanoes, forest fires and evaporation from seawater. Man made carbon dioxide is produced by combustion processes and released to the atmosphere in chimney emissions from power stations, motor vehicles and other processes where fuels containing carbon are burnt. The concentration of carbon dioxide has increased by around 30% since the industrial revolution, mainly as a result of the combustion of fossil fuels.</main_methods_of_release>

  <pollutant id="5">
    <pollutant_name>Nitrous Oxide</pollutant_name>
    <main_uses>As a weak anaesthetic gas, nitrous oxide has been in use since the 19th century in medicine and dentistry. It is used in the dairy industry as a mixing and foaming agent as it is non-flammable, bacteriostatic (stops bacteria from growing) and leaves no taste or odour. In motor sport it is used to speed engines and it is even used in diving to avoid nitrogen narcosis and other effects experienced in deep dives.</main_uses>
    <main_methods_of_release>Nitrous oxide is produced both naturally-from a wide variety of biological sources in soil and water-and anthropogenically by a variety of agricultural, energy-related, industrial and waste management activities. Nitrous oxide is also produced naturally in soils through microbial processes of nitrification and denitrification. The two major sources of man-made nitrous oxide emissions are in general agricultural soils and the manufacture of adipic acid (a feedstock for nylon manufacture) and nitric acids. Lower level emissions arise from combustion processes in the power generation sector and from road transport. Of the emissions from agricultural soils the most significant sources are fertiliser application and leaching. Emissions from road transport are increasing as a result of the increasing number of petrol driven cars fitted with 3 way catalytic converters, since the converters produce significantly larger emissions of nitrous oxide. The contribution of road transport is minor but important because it is steadily growing in contrast to the other sectors which are declining. </main_methods_of_release>

    <description>Under normal environmental conditions dinitrogen oxide (more commonly known as nitrous oxide) is a colourless gas with a slight sweetish taste and odour. It is non flammable itself but will support combustion and is only slightly soluble in water. It has an anaesthetic and an analgesic property, offering pain relief when inhaled in sufficient amounts. In the 19th century it was termed 'laughing gas' after the amusing effects it had on people that inhaled it. </description>

					The CITL viewer provides data related to the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS): greenhouse gas emissions and annual allowances are available by Member State, trading sector, installation size and year. Country groupings are available for EU-27, EU-25, EU-15, EU-10 and EU-2 (Bulgaria and Romania). The intention of the CITL viewer is to support governments, market players and other stakeholders in their assessment of the EU ETS.

<h3>What is the CITL viewer?</h3>
<p>The CITL viewer enables users to better assess the data on installations and emissions covered by the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. It incorporates data from the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/ets/">Community Independent Transaction Log (CITL)</a>, the emissions registry run by the European Commission for greenhouse gases. Users can retrieve data on the amount of emissions generated by various trading sectors (combustion plants, oil refineries, coke ovens, iron and steel plants, and factories making cement, glass, lime, brick, ceramics, pulp and paper) in any EU&amp;nbsp;Member State&amp;nbsp;for the first period of the ETS, namely 2005–2007. In addition, the viewer features up-to-date information to determine if a particular trading sector was granted too many or too few allowances compared to their actual level of emissions.</p>
<p>Data come in a single document, encapsulated in an Excel format spreadsheet. Once the file is downloaded to a given computer, the user may generate graphs and retrieve country or sector-specific information. A comprehensive manual with instructions, in electronic format, is included in the viewer.</p>
<p>Over 11&amp;nbsp;000 industrial installations in Europe — which represent close to half of Europe's emissions of CO2 — are covered by the EU&amp;nbsp;Emission Trading Scheme. The ultimate goal of the EU ETS is to help EU Member States achieve conformity with their present and future commitments to combat climate change under the Kyoto Protocol, and it is the first international trading system for GHG in the world.</p>
<p>The CITL viewer complements the <a href="http://dataservice.eea.europa.eu/pivotapp/pivot.aspx?pivotid=455">EEA greenhouse gas data viewer</a> — an interactive tool that allows easy web access to the main emissions data submitted by the European Community to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).</p>

					Europe is a world leader in eco-efficient technologies. The EU's eco-industries, which employ more than two million people, account for about one third of the global market and are growing by around 5 % a year. However, substantial barriers to the exploitation of these opportunities remain, especially environmentally-damaging subsidies and the absence of financial incentives to eco-innovate. The move towards a continent-wide zero-emission sustainable economy era depends on a combination of actions that involve all segments of society: from governments to researchers, enterprises and individual citizens.

50th anniversary website</p>
</div>

<p>This year not only marks the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome,
but also 35 years of European Union environmental policy. The European
Environment Agency celebrates the occasion by looking back at the last
50 years and reflecting on the environmental challenges that lie
ahead.</p>

<h2>What we are celebrating</h2>

<p>On 25 March 1957, six countries signed the <a
href="http://europa.eu/abc/treaties/index_en.htm" target="_self">Treaty
of Rome</a>, establishing the European Economic Community. Their aim
was to create a Common Market in order to secure prosperity, peace and
stability. Environment was not part of the policy package.</p>

<p>But rising awareness, the first major environmental disasters in the
1950s and the 1960s, and the iconic images of our fragile planet as
seen for the first time from space, led to the breakthrough of the
environmental movement in the 1970s.</p>

<p>In 1972, the EU’s environmental policy was formally founded by a
European Council declaration and the first five-year Environment Action
Programme was adopted.</p>

<p>Today, sustainable development and environmental protection are
among the core values of the European Union, which now counts 27 Member
States. The EU is a frontrunner on many environmental issues, in terms
of policy-making as well as information-provision.</p>

<p>AirBase is a public air quality database containing air quality monitoring information for more than 30 participating countries throughout Europe.</p>
<p>Every year countries report air quality measurement data for a set of pollutants at a representative selection of stations. Reporting follows the requirements of the Council Decision 97/101/EC, a reciprocal Exchange of Information (EoI) on ambient air quality.</p>
<p>Statistics calculated on the reported data are also stored in AirBase.</p>
<p>AirBase is managed by the <a class="external-link" href="http://etc-acc.eionet.europa.eu/">European Topic Centre on Air and Climate Change (ETC/ACC)</a> on behalf of the EEA.</p>
<p>There is a large amount of data on Europe’s air quality over the last decade and you can browse it in different ways.</p>
<h2>Live maps and data<br /></h2>
<ul><li>Map air quality statistics at&amp;nbsp;reporting stations. The example shows the annual averages for particulate matter (PM<sub>10</sub>) in 2005. <a class="external-link" href="map-statistics">You can select the pollutant, the statistic and the year that you want to see</a>.</li></ul>

<ul><li>See where reporting <a class="external-link" href="map-stations">stations are located</a>, what their characteristics are and what they measured. The example shows the urban, industrial, traffic and rural stations that have measured particulate matter (PM<sub>10</sub>). You can zoom in by clicking on the map or by writing the name of a place. When you zoom in, the background map will also show land cover information. Click on a station to display its data.</li></ul>

<p>AirBase is a public air quality database containing air quality monitoring information for more than 30 participating countries throughout Europe.</p>
<p>Every year countries report air quality measurement data for a set of pollutants at a representative selection of stations. Reporting follows the requirements of the Council Decision 97/101/EC, a reciprocal Exchange of Information (EoI) on ambient air quality.</p>
<p>Statistics calculated on the reported data are also stored in AirBase.</p>
<p>AirBase is managed by the <a class="external-link" href="http://etc-acc.eionet.europa.eu/">European Topic Centre on Air and Climate Change (ETC/ACC)</a> on behalf of the EEA.</p>
<p>There is a large amount of data on Europe’s air quality over the last decade and you can browse it in different ways.</p>
<h2>Live maps and data<br /></h2>
<ul><li>Map air quality statistics at&amp;nbsp;reporting stations. The example shows the annual averages for particulate matter (PM<sub>10</sub>) in 2005. <a class="external-link" href="map-statistics">You can select the pollutant, the statistic and the year that you want to see</a>.</li></ul>

<ul><li>See where reporting <a class="external-link" href="map-stations">stations are located</a>, what their characteristics are and what they measured. The example shows the urban, industrial, traffic and rural stations that have measured particulate matter (PM<sub>10</sub>). You can zoom in by clicking on the map or by writing the name of a place. When you zoom in, the background map will also show land cover information. Click on a station to display its data.</li></ul>

<p><strong>In 35 years, EU’s environmental policy has made huge strides. Initially, policy focused on the development of a vast body of environmental legislation, dealing
mostly with technical standards. Gradually, the spectrum of policy tools has broadened, with e.g. the introduction of the use of market-based instruments.</strong></p>

<p>Environmental concerns are also increasingly being integrated into other policy areas, such as energy, agriculture and transport. This helps to prevent the problems at
their source instead of using end-of-pipe solutions only.</p>

<p>Today, the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/" target="_self">EU sustainable development strategy</a> provides the overarching long-term framework, aiming
at synergies between economic, social and environmental goals. The EU has established environmental cooperation with its new eastern and southern European neighbours. It
has taken environmental leadership globally.</p>

<p>European environmental protection legislation works, when it is fully implemented and enforced. Without it, our environment would look quite different. For
instance:</p>

<ul>
<li>lead would still be being pumped into the air from much of our car fleet;</li>

<li>chlorofluorocarbons would have further depleted the ozone layer;</li>

<li>nitrogen oxide emissions from road transport would be 10 times higher;</li>

<li>life in our rivers, lakes and estuaries would still be choked by effluent, not to mention the unsavoury prospect of bathing in coastal waters polluted by sewage;</li>

<li>increasing swathes of land would be eaten up by expanding landfills for waste — waste incinerators would not be operating to such strict standards.</li>
</ul>

<p>Today, the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/" target="_self">EU sustainable development strategy</a> provides the overarching long-term framework, aiming
at synergies between economic, social and environmental goals. The EU has established environmental cooperation with its new eastern and southern European neighbours. It
has taken environmental leadership globally.</p>

<p>European environmental protection legislation works, when it is fully implemented and enforced. Without it, our environment would look quite different. For
instance:</p>

<ul>
<li>lead would still be being pumped into the air from much of our car fleet;</li>

<li>chlorofluorocarbons would have further depleted the ozone layer;</li>

<li>nitrogen oxide emissions from road transport would be 10 times higher;</li>

<li>life in our rivers, lakes and estuaries would still be choked by effluent, not to mention the unsavoury prospect of bathing in coastal waters polluted by sewage;</li>

<li>increasing swathes of land would be eaten up by expanding landfills for waste — waste incinerators would not be operating to such strict standards.</li>
</ul>

					Policies have a key role in determining the state of our environment. The EU has 35 years' experience of environmental policy-making, during which time well over 200 legal acts have been put in place and strategic paths have been defined. Initially, policy focused on regulating technical standards. Gradually, the spectrum of policy instruments has broadened, recognising that there is no single universal policy tool that can provide solutions to all problems. The EU 6th environmental action programme promotes a blend of instruments: legal requirements ('command and control' measures), technology transfer, market-based instruments, research, environmental liability provisions, green public procurement and voluntary schemes and agreements. The EEA's policy effectiveness studies show that the institutional setup can be as important as the design of the policy itself.

<p>The EU environmental legislation package is recognised as one of the strongest in the world. It works — when it is fully implemented and enforced. Without it, our environment would look quite different. We have cleaned up our water and our air, phased out some ozone-depleting substances and have doubled rates of waste recycling. Our cars pollute less; without the improvements made by catalytic converters over the past 20 years, some emissions would be ten times the level they are now.</p>
<p>Today, the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/" target="_self">EU Sustainable Development Strategy</a> provides the overarching long-term framework, aiming at synergies between economic, social and environmental goals. The EU Treaty requires environmental protection to be integrated into the definition and implementation of all Community policies, such as energy, agriculture and transport. This '<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/integration.htm">environmental integration</a>' helps prevent problems at their source instead of using 'end-of-pipe' solutions only.</p>
<p>The EU is working on a more integrated approach to policy making, guided by the principles of <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/governance/better_regulation/impact_en.htm">impact assessment and better regulation</a>. This also includes recommendations for improving public participation in managing the interactions between science, technologies and society — prerequisites for the application of the precautionary principle.</p>
<p>Market-based instruments such as tradable permits of pollutants and environmental taxes are rising up the EU agenda. They aim to bring the environmental and health costs of economic activities into market prices and to put a price on the use of natural resources like air, water and soil. Recent examples are the EU emission trading scheme and harmonised environmental taxation such as the Taxation of Energy Products Directive and the 'Eurovignette' Directive for freight transport. The elimination of environmentally-damaging subsidies is also a priority. The 2007 <a class="external-link" href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/enveco/green_paper.htm">Green Paper on Market-based instruments</a> for environment and related policy purposes reinvigorates the idea of environmental tax reform, i.e. shifting from labour taxation to environmental taxation.</p>
<p>'Socialism failed in saying the economic truth. Capitalism may fail in saying the ecological truth' (Lester Brown, Fortune Brainstorm Conference, 2006).</p>

<p>Environmental technologies provide solutions to decrease material inputs, reduce energy consumption and emissions, recover valuable by-products and minimise waste disposal problems. They enhance eco-efficiency, or in other words, 'do more with less', support the application of environmental management systems and make production processes cleaner.</p>
<p>There are great opportunities in Europe to make better use of the latest technologies in energy, transport and materials use. European companies are particularly strong in renewable power generation, and waste management and recycling where they have a global market share of 40&amp;nbsp;% and 50&amp;nbsp;% respectively.</p>
<p>Environmental technologies are also used to collect information about the environment — monitoring and gathering data to identify the presence of pollutants, changes in land cover, or to detect human health effects with bio-monitoring.</p>
<p>Environmental technologies have the potential over the next decade to contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 25–80&amp;nbsp;%, to ozone depletion by 50&amp;nbsp;% and to acidification and eutrophication by up to 50&amp;nbsp;%. For the water industry, the challenge is to develop new and cost-effective technologies that take into account environmental externalities and energy aspects. Significant technology enhancements and market expansion are also expected for small-scale waste-to-energy solutions and the development of small-scale energy systems based on biomass.</p>
<p>To realise the potential of environmental technologies, greater market acceptance needs to be created. A lack of awareness of the real costs of obtaining, using and disposing of materials and energy is still a significant barrier to the wider implementation of many eco-innovations.</p>
<p>Customers and investors must know more precisely the performance and environmental benefits of different technologies so they can purchase and finance products with confidence that are often new to the market. To support this, policy-makers in Europe are currently discussing how to carry out such verifications of these technologies.</p>

					Evaluation of policy effectiveness plays an important role in the formulation and improvement of policies. Assessing the effects of EU environmental instruments, and whether specific measures have actually been effective in delivering expected results, is an essential task. We have to ask difficult questions such as: are environmental policies actually working, are they cost-effective? If not, how can they be improved? These are the questions the EEA addresses in its work on policy effectiveness and market-based instruments. Currently, particular attention is devoted to the potential of environmental tax reform.

<p>The 2001 report <a class="external-link" href="http://reports.eea.europa.eu/rem/en">Reporting on environmental measures: Are we effective?</a> set the methodological framework for the EEA's ex-post policy effectiveness evaluations.

Studies on the effectiveness of market-based instruments for sustainable resource management and on the effectiveness of implementing the Structural and Cohesion Funds are ongoing.</p>
<p>Since 1996 the EEA has regularly reported on the experiences of market-based instruments (MBIs). This includes exploring the potential of environmental tax reform, not only for employment, but also for innovation and competitiveness and, in particular, for <a title="Environmental technology" class="internal-link" href="resolveuid/0742501c1bd96c82e8bb993ee49f120c">stimulating&amp;nbsp; 'eco-innovation'</a>.

<p>We see the first large oil spills from super tankers, but also the founding of the first international environmental Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) — the World

Action Programme, and starts developing a vast body of Community environmental legislation.</p>

<p>An oil price shock is sparked by the Arab–Israel war and triggers action on energy efficiency. An explosion near Seveso, Italy, releases a toxic cloud containing
dioxin. The first World Climate Conference takes place. A panel on climate change set up by the National Academy of Sciences in USA advises that ‘A wait-and-see policy may
mean waiting until it is too late’.<br />
</p>

<p>Membership of the EEC grows to nine with the accession of Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom.</p>

					Transport accounts for around a third of all final energy consumption in the EEA member countries and for more than a fifth of greenhouse gas emissions. It is also responsible for a large share of urban air pollution as well as noise nuisance. Furthermore, transport has a serious impact on the landscape because it divides natural areas into small patches with serious consequences for animals and plants.

<p><a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/etap/index_en.htm">ETAP</a> complements the European Commission's regulatory approaches and directly addresses the three dimensions of the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/growthandjobs/index_en.htm">Lisbon Strategy</a>: growth, jobs and the environment. Based on ETAP, Member States have developed formal <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/etap/roadmaps_en.htm">National Roadmaps</a>, describing plans, actions and achievements relevant to environmental technologies and eco-innovations.</p>
<p>Research and development is an important element of the Lisbon Strategy, which aims 'to make Europe the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world'. The European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) for Research (2007–2013) is also expected to play a key role in achieving the Lisbon objectives. A number of <a href="http://cordis.europa.eu/technology-platforms/individual_en.html">European Technology Platforms</a> will continue to direct FP7 towards the needs of industry. These address technology topics such as wind energy, hydrogen fuel cells, photovoltaics and zero emission fossil fuel power plants. Such platforms will have a major influence on Europe's innovative capacity for transforming knowledge and innovation into added economic value and environmental sustainability.</p>
<p>Europe's journey towards zero-emissions was set in motion by a number of targets: a 20&amp;nbsp;% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 (compared to 1990 levels); 20&amp;nbsp;% of energy to come from renewable sources by 2020; and 10&amp;nbsp;% of road transport fuel to come from biofuels. Such targets have created considerable potential for new energy technologies and for the transformation of decade-old energy regimes. The 21st century will see a reconfiguration of the power grids with new, smaller, more widely distributed renewable energy production technologies that operate at more local levels, even down to individual households.</p>
<p>Technologies alone cannot solve Europe's environmental problems. A combination of approaches is needed, from legislative measures to voluntary actions, to achieve clear economic and environmental advantages. Regulations such as the Directive on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) have proved to be an effective way of encouraging industry and businesses in Europe to reduce waste and adopt recycling by promoting the use of clean technology.&amp;nbsp; Similarly, voluntary approaches such as the eco-management and auditing scheme (EMAS) have elicited continuous environmental performance improvements for thousands of industries and organisations in Europe.</p>

<h2 class="Heading">Cooperation with EU Institutions</h2>
<h3 class="Subheading">European Commission</h3>
<p>EEA's interaction with the European Commission needs to be ensured at the proper points in the policy-making cycle. This is facilitated by a greater trend towards multi-annual work programming in the Commission and the Agency. This offers the opportunity for a greater dovetailing between the <a href="resolveuid/cb90a8aef53a1edd501fb184b9d36dab">EEA Strategy and its Annual Management Plan (AMP)</a> and the Commission’s Annual Policy Strategy (APS) and Commission Work Programme (CWP).</p>
<p>The Directorate General (DG) Environment (<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/index_en.htm">DG ENV</a>) is EEA's main counterpart at the European Commission and provides input in the elaboration of the EEA Annual Management Plan.</p>
<p>Within the so-called "Group of Four", the EEA, DG ENV, the <a href="http://ies.jrc.cec.eu.int/index.html">Institute for Environment and Sustainability</a> of the Joint Research Centre and <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page?_pageid=1090,30070682,1090_33076576&amp;amp;_dad=portal&amp;amp;_schema=PORTAL">Eurostat</a> agreed on a division of tasks in environmental reporting.</p>
<p>As environmental considerations are being more and more integrated in sectoral policies, the EEA also cooperates with other <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs_en.htm">Directorates General of the European Commission</a>, such as Transport and Energy, Research, Agriculture and Regional Policy DGs.</p>
<h3 class="Subheading">European Parliament</h3>
<p>The EEA supports the European Parliament with briefings, workshops, informal meetings and, upon request, participates in hearings. Particular cooperation takes place with the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/activities/committees/homeCom.do?language=&amp;amp;body=ENVI">Committee for Environment, Public Health and Food Safety</a> and the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/activities/committees/homeCom.do?language=&amp;amp;body=CLIM">Temporary Committee on Climate Change</a>. The EEA also works together with many of the other <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/activities/committees/committeesList.do?language=EN">19 Committees</a>, such as the Transport and Tourism, Agriculture and Rural Development and Regional Development Committees.</p>
<h3 class="Subheading">Council of the European Union</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/showPage.ASP?lang=en">The Council of the European Union</a> is the main decision-making body of the European Union. The Executive Director of the EEA is regularly invited to attend the informal meetings of the environment ministers. Exceptionally, Prof. McGlade also participates in informal meetings on other policy areas, such as on territorial cohesion under the Portuguese Presidency in late 2007. In addition, the EEA supports the environmental activities of the rotating EU Presidencies by e.g., preparing reports or organising workshops and seminars upon request.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/showPage.ASP?lang=en"></a></p>
<h2 class="Heading">EU advisory bodies</h2>
<p>The EEA works together with EU advisory bodies i.e., the <a href="http://www.cor.europa.eu/en/index.htm">Committee of the Regions </a> and the <a href="http://www.eesc.europa.eu/index_en.asp">European Economic and Social Committee</a>, upon their request. This includes participation in conferences, input to their rapporteurs and informal contacts.</p>
<h2 class="Heading">Community agencies</h2>
<p>The EEA is one of the <a href="http://europa.eu/agencies/community_agencies/index_en.htm">Community Agencies</a> that have been set up in order to accomplish specific technical, scientific or managerial tasks.</p>
<p>The Network of Heads of European Agencies has been set up to coordinate issues of common interest. It provides a forum for exchange of information and discussion on common topics and administrative and management issues. It usually meets three times a year.</p>

This offers the opportunity for a greater dovetailing between the <a href="resolveuid/cb90a8aef53a1edd501fb184b9d36dab">EEA Strategy and its Annual Management Plan (AMP)</a> and the Commission’s Annual Policy Strategy (APS) and Commission Work Programme (CWP).</p>
<p>The Directorate General (DG) Environment (<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/index_en.htm">DG ENV</a>) is EEA's main counterpart at the European Commission and provides input in the elaboration of the EEA Annual Management Plan.</p>
<p>Within the so-called "Group of Four", the EEA, DG ENV, the <a href="http://ies.jrc.cec.eu.int/index.html">Institute for Environment and Sustainability</a> of the Joint Research Centre and <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page?_pageid=1090,30070682,1090_33076576&amp;amp;_dad=portal&amp;amp;_schema=PORTAL">Eurostat</a> agreed on a division of tasks in environmental reporting.</p>
<p>As environmental considerations are being more and more integrated in sectoral policies, the EEA also cooperates with other <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs_en.htm">Directorates General of the European Commission</a>, such as Transport and Energy, Research, Agriculture and Regional Policy DGs.</p>
<h3 class="Subheading">European Parliament</h3>
<p>The EEA supports the European Parliament with briefings, workshops, informal meetings and, upon request, participates in hearings. Particular cooperation takes place with the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/activities/committees/homeCom.do?language=&amp;amp;body=ENVI">Committee for Environment, Public Health and Food Safety</a> and the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/activities/committees/homeCom.do?language=&amp;amp;body=CLIM">Temporary Committee on Climate Change</a>. The EEA also works together with many of the other <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/activities/committees/committeesList.do?language=EN">19 Committees</a>, such as the Transport and Tourism, Agriculture and Rural Development and Regional Development Committees.</p>
<h3 class="Subheading">Council of the European Union</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/showPage.ASP?lang=en">The Council of the European Union</a> is the main decision-making body of the European Union. The Executive Director of the EEA is regularly invited to attend the informal meetings of the environment ministers. Exceptionally, Prof. McGlade also participates in informal meetings on other policy areas, such as on territorial cohesion under the Portuguese Presidency in late 2007. In addition, the EEA supports the environmental activities of the rotating EU Presidencies by e.g., preparing reports or organising workshops and seminars upon request.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/showPage.ASP?lang=en"></a></p>
<h2 class="Heading">EU advisory bodies</h2>
<p>The EEA works together with EU advisory bodies i.e., the <a href="http://www.cor.europa.eu/en/index.htm">Committee of the Regions </a> and the <a href="http://www.eesc.europa.eu/index_en.asp">European Economic and Social Committee</a>, upon their request. This includes participation in conferences, input to their rapporteurs and informal contacts.</p>
<h2 class="Heading">Community agencies</h2>
<p>The EEA is one of the <a href="http://europa.eu/agencies/community_agencies/index_en.htm">Community Agencies</a> that have been set up in order to accomplish specific technical, scientific or managerial tasks.</p>
<p>The Network of Heads of European Agencies has been set up to coordinate issues of common interest. It provides a forum for exchange of information and discussion on common topics and administrative and management issues. It usually meets three times a year.</p>

					Transport accounts for around a third of all final energy consumption in the EEA member countries and for more than a fifth of greenhouse gas emissions. It is also responsible for a large share of urban air pollution as well as noise nuisance. Furthermore, transport has a serious impact on the landscape because it divides natural areas into small patches with serious consequences for animals and plants.

<p>At the same time, transport is an essential element of our modern society: it ensures access to jobs, goods and services, education, leisure and tourism activities. Modern two-income households are even more dependent on transport because it is increasingly common that at least one person must commute a significant distance. This is partly a result of the increasing specialisation of labour. Furthermore, tasks such as shopping increasingly rely on transport because of the tendency for shopping areas to be concentrated in fewer places, away from residential areas which are often devoid of shopping facilities.</p>
<p>Transport volumes are growing: 1.9 % annually for passenger and 2.7 % for freight transport. This growth is outpacing the improvements in energy efficiency of the various transport modes. As a result, energy consumption and emissions of greenhouse gases by transport are increasing. This is further exacerbated by a shift away from more environmentally efficient rail and bus transport towards cars and aircraft.</p>
<p>A particular concern is aviation, which is the fastest-growing transport sector. This growth is partly driven by increasing wealth and low prices (aviation does not pay fuel tax), which underpin strong growth in tourism travel. Aviation now accounts for more than 10&amp;nbsp;% of greenhouse gas emissions, if international aviation is included in the statistics.</p>
<p>In spite of the growth in transport, related emissions of harmful substances such as carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons, particulates and nitrous oxides are decreasing as stricter emission standards are imposed for cars and trucks. Concentrations of particulate matter (PM) and ozone have however not generally shown any improvement since 1997. Fine particulate matter and ground-level ozone are now generally recognised as being the main threats to human health from air pollution, and transport is a main contributor to these (<a class="external-link" href="../air">Air pollution</a>, <a class="external-link" href="../human">Environment and health</a>).</p>
<p>One of the reasons why some air quality problems persist even though vehicles become cleaner, is that emissions in real driving conditions tend to be higher than emissions under test conditions.</p>
<p>Traffic noise affects a large share of the population. The World Health Organization estimates that about 40 % of the population in the EU is exposed to road traffic noise at levels exceeding 55 dB(A), and that more than 30 % is exposed to levels exceeding 55 dB(A) during the night (<a title="Noise" class="internal-link" href="resolveuid/5757e1ebd370ac9f0b9d9c4c41667304">Noise</a>).</p>

<p>Tourism is big business. It is one of the world's largest industries and in many regions the single largest source of investment and employment. While it does not have the same 'smokestack' image as the manufacturing industry, it is by no means environmentally benign, generating significant levels of pollution and consuming considerable amounts of natural resources. Europe is the world’s favourite tourist destination and so faces considerable challenges in making its tourist industry more environmentally friendly. One of the biggest beneficiaries of a more sustainable tourism industry will be the industry itself — fewer people will want to visit a region where mass tourism has blighted the countryside and polluted the beaches.</p>

					Understanding household consumption patterns is about understanding human behaviour. Consumption patterns in Europe are very different to those 50 years ago. Important factors that drive our consumption include growing incomes, globalisation of the economy, technological breakthroughs (such as the Internet and mobile phones), decreasing household sizes and an ageing population. At the same time, the growing number of goods and services we consume often offsets the efficiency gains we achieved through for example, improved production technologies and processes. As a result, environmental pressures are increasing. Housing, food and drink, and mobility have the greatest environmental impact over their lifecycle in terms of emissions of greenhouse gases, acidifying and ozone-depleting substances as well as resource use.

					Acidification is the process whereby air pollution  mainly ammonia, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides  is converted into acid substances.
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
This acid rain is best known for the damage it causes to forests and lakes. Less well known are the many ways it damages freshwater and coastal ecosystems, soils and even ancient historical monuments, or the heavy metals these acids help release into groundwater.
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
Sulphur dioxide and the nitrogen oxides are mainly emitted by burning fossil fuels. As some of the reports in this section show, the 1990s saw these emissions drop substantially, thanks to a combination of European Directives forcing the installation of desulphurisation systems, the move away from coal as a fossil fuel, and major economic restructuring in the new German Lander.
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
Acidification is nevertheless still a major environmental problem in Europe. It is a cross-border issue, requiring coordinated initiatives across countries and sectors. This section brings together the EEAs reports on the scale of the problem and the effectiveness of the solutions tried to date.

<p>With farmers managing almost half of the EU's land area, the agricultural sector is a major source of pressure on Europe's environment. Over the past five decades, the
European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)&amp;nbsp;— accounting for around half of the EU budget&amp;nbsp;— has encouraged the sector to become more and more intensive, as
has the growing globalisation of the world's economy.</p>

<p>As a result, the agricultural sector is responsible for a large share of the pollution of surface waters and seas by nutrients, for the loss of biodiversity, and for
pesticide residues in groundwater. Reforms of the CAP in the 1990s, and measures taken by the sector itself, have brought about some improvements, but more is needed to
balance agricultural production, rural development, and the environment.</p>

<p>Human ingenuity has produced well over 100 000 new chemicals — substances which have never before been part of the terrestrial environment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some, such as substances containing heavy metals and 'persistent organic pollutants', have been known to be dangerous for many years already, while fears have been raised about many others recently. For most of these chemicals, however, we simply do not know how they pass through the environment, whether they are accumulated, dispersed or transformed, and how they affect living organisms at different concentrations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We do know that emissions of many chemicals, known to be dangerous, have dropped, but that there are many areas where their concentrations in the environment are still too high. We also know that Europe's chemical industry is growing faster than the economy as a whole, increasing the flow of chemicals through Europe's economy. Initiatives aimed at reducing this flow must span the entire chain: the primary producers in the chemicals industry, all sectors of industry, individual consumers, the waste disposal sector, and more.</p>

<p>Climate change is one of our greatest environmental, social and economic threats. The warming of the climate system is unequivocal, says the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Observations show increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global mean sea level. It is very likely that most of the warming can be attributed to the emissions of greenhouse gases by human activities. <a title="About climate change" class="moreLink" href="resolveuid/5f6c720ab567e4b4208a1d457fc4a010">More</a></p>

					Energy gives personal comfort and mobility to people, and is essential for the generation of industrial, commercial and societal wealth.

These pressures include the emission of greenhouse gases and air pollutants, land-use, waste generation and oil spills. They contribute to climate change, damage natural ecosystems and the man-made environment, and cause adverse effects to human health.

<p>If environmental problems are rarely simple, the solutions never are. A few issues can be tackled by using regulations to force companies to adopt new technologies, but these are the 'low hanging fruit' — solving many problems requires changing the attitudes and habits of millions of people, altering entire industrial structures, finding innovative ways to fund the introduction of new technologies, and more besides.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This section therefore presents studies on environmental management, examining the solutions which businesses, industrial leaders, environmental professionals, local authorities, and others are experimenting with across Europe.</p>

<p>There is a critical overcapacity in the European fishing fleet. Over-fishing can have serious consequences for the entire marine environment. Certain trawling techniques, for example, cause damage to the highly important seabed habitat. At the other end of the food chain, seabirds, seals, whales and other marine mammals will be left with nothing to eat.</p>
<p>The key question is whether Europe can avoid 'fishing out' its remaining stocks and instead develop an industry that is sustainable for both the environment and those making a living from it. This section looks at the reform of the EU's Common Fisheries Policy, which is designed to make that happen, and presents studies of fish stocks, fishing fleet activity, and potential alternatives, such as fish farming.</p>

<p>This is partly because industry was the first target of environmental regulation. It is also easier to force through changes in a few thousand companies than convince hundreds of millions of people to alter their lifestyles and habits.

Some of these resources, such as minerals, species, and habitats, are finite — once they have been exhausted or destroyed, they are gone forever. Others, such as air, water, and wood, are renewable — although we generally rely on the Earth's natural systems to regrow, renew, and purify them for us. Although many effects of over-exploitation are felt locally, the growing interdependence of nations and international trade in natural resources make their management a global issue.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This section looks at these resources, examines whether we are treating them sustainably, and studies how new technologies and approaches can help us make better use of them.</p>

Extending from the Arctic Circle to the Mediterranean and from the Alps to the Canary Islands, Europe is home to a stunning diversity of natural and semi-natural habitats.
The pressures threatening these habitats are almost as diverse, ranging from tourism to agriculture, eutrophication to urban sprawl. This section examines the health of
these ecosystems, their place in the environment, the outlook for the animals and plants inhabiting them, the pressures facing them, and the initiatives under way to
protect them.

<p></p>
While the last two decades have seen significant reductions in the noise produced by all sorts of vehicles, the rapid growth in transport — particularly air and road — has resulted in well over 120 million people in the EU being exposed to noise levels above 55 Ldn dB(A) on the front facade of their houses.

					The destruction of the ozone layer, which protects all living things from harmful ultraviolet solar radiation, was one of the first, global environmental problems to be understood by the general population and tackled by the international community.
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
The subsequent measures against the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), halons, and other ozone depleting chemicals made their production and emission drop significantly. As a result, the total concentration of chlorine in the lower atmosphere peaked in 1994. The long life of those substances in the atmosphere means that full recovery of the ozone layer is unlikely before 2050, however.
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
The remaining policy challenges for European countries are to tighten control measures, to reduce the production and use of HCFCs and methyl bromide, to manage banks of existing ozone-depleting substances, and to support developing countries in their reduction of the use of ozone-depleting substances.

<p>It is too simplistic to equate a growing population or economy with environmental damage. Reality is a little more complex, as the material in this section will show.</p>
<p>What is clear is that the level of growth seen in today's economy and population increases our environmental problems, as neither the economy nor the size of the population have been 'decoupled' from environmental damage.</p>
<p>This is not, however, inevitable. If the population growth was accompanied by a tendency towards smaller numbers of large households, for example, environmental pressures from the 'household' sector could well decrease. Unfortunately, Europe's demographic trends currently point in the opposite direction: the number of households is actually increasing faster than the population as a whole, as families shrink and the number of one-person households grows.</p>
<p>Similarly, the growth in production in many sectors is still closely linked with increased consumption of energy and resources and more pollution. There are, however, many examples of a 'decoupling' of economy and environment, and of changing consumption patterns. Reports in this section document these trends.</p>

<p>While soils are as essential to human society as air and water, soil degradation has not received nearly as much attention as the threats to these other two elements. Still soils are the basis for 90 % of all human food, livestock feed, fibre, and fuel. They support human settlements and provide raw materials and groundwater. Major problems in Europe include: loss of top-soil due to erosion or building activities, contamination, and acidification.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lack of attention to soil degradation can be seen not only in the lack of European directives or soil protection targets, but also in the scarcity of data. While, for instance, 300 000 sites across the EU have been identified as definitely or potentially contaminated, the best estimate is that there are 1.5 million contaminated areas.</p>

					For the first time in human history, more people are living in towns and cities than in rural areas. Europe is one of the most urbanised continents. Approximately 75 % of its population lives in urban areas; by 2020, this will be 80 %. As a result, the demand for land in and around cities is becoming acute; urban sprawl is re-shaping landscapes and affecting people's quality of life and the environment as never before. Urban planning and management have risen high on the political agenda, with transport and housing as crucial challenges.

					The European economy is based on a high level of resource consumption. This includes raw materials (such as metals, construction minerals or wood), energy and land. The main driving forces of Europe's resource consumption are economic growth, technological developments and changing consumption and production patterns. About one third of resources used are turned into waste and emissions. Around four tonnes of waste per capita are generated every year in the EEA member countries.

<p>Biodiversity embraces the variety of genes, species and ecosystems that constitute life on Earth. We are currently witnessing a steady loss of biodiversity, with
profound consequences for the natural world and for human wellbeing. The main causes are changes in natural habitats. These are due to intensive agricultural production
systems, construction, quarrying, overexploitation of forests, oceans, rivers, lakes and soils, alien species invasions, pollution and — increasingly — global climate
change. Europe has set a target for halting the loss of biodiversity by 2010. Recent EEA assessments show that without significant additional policy efforts, it is
unlikely that the target will be reached. <a title="About biodiversity" class="moreLink" href="resolveuid/010842e332c8b266116132747af197ec">More</a><br />

					Transport is integral to most activities in our society. It is therefore being dealt with by policy at all levels, from the global level (i.e. United Nations) to city councils. Of key importance is solving the dilemma between growth-oriented policies which tend to generate more transport, and environmental policies that call for emission reductions. The latter can be hard to achieve as long as technology improvements reducing emissions are outweighed by increasing transport volumes.

<p><b>This is the decade of international commitments to sustainable development and of the consolidation of the importance of environmental information. The UN holds a
summit on the environment and development in Rio de Janeiro. The Agenda 21 programme is adopted.</b></p>

<p>The European Environment Agency sets up office in Copenhagen. Its aim is to provide independent, reliable and comparable environmental information for decision-makers
and the public.</p>

<p>The Aarhus Convention is a milestone in the push for access to environmental information.</p>

<p>The European Community becomes the European Union through the Maastricht Treaty, which also strengthens the role of the European Parliament in making environmental
policy. Later, the EU adopts the Amsterdam Treaty, which states that environmental protection requirements are to be integrated into Community policies and
activities.<br />
</p>

<p>Membership of the Union rises to 15 with the accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, seen by many as pioneers in environmental policy.<br />
</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p><strong>1990</strong><br />
East and West Germany are united in October.</p>

<p><strong>1990</strong><br />
A Council Regulation is issued establishing the <a href="http://www.eea.europa.eu/" target="_self">European Environment Agency</a> and the <a
href="http://eionet.europa.eu/" target="_self">European environment information and observation network (Eionet)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>1990</strong><br />
The first report of the International Panel on Climate Change sparks the beginning of formal negotiations towards an international agreement on climate change.</p>

<p><strong>1990 +<br />
</strong>Adoption of, among others, the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (1991), the Habitats Directive (1992), the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive (1994),
the Air Quality Framework Directive (1996), and the Integrated Pollution Prevention Control Directive (1996).</p>

<p><strong>1991</strong><br />
The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe initiates the <a href="http://www.unece.org/env/efe/welcome.html" target="_self">Environment for Europe</a> process with
the first pan-European conference of environment ministers at Dobris, Prague.</p>

<p><strong>1992</strong><br />
At the UN summit on the environment and development in Rio de Janeiro, the <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/documents/agenda21/index.htm" target="_self">Agenda
21</a> programme is adopted. The Community and its Member States sign the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Biodiversity.</p>

<p><strong>1992</strong><br />
The EU’s 5th Environment Action Programme puts integration of environment into other policy areas at its core, signalling a shift from purely regulatory measures to an
emphasis on economic and fiscal measures.</p>

<p><strong>1993</strong><br />
The <a href="http://europa.eu/abc/treaties/index_en.htm" target="_self">Maastricht Treaty</a> enters into force, creating the <a title="European Union"
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union">European Union</a>.</p>

<p><strong>1994</strong><br />
The <a href="http://www.eea.europa.eu/" target="_self">European Environment Agency</a> sets up office in Copenhagen in 1994. It aims to provide independent, reliable and
comparable environmental information for decision-makers and the public.</p>

<p><strong>1994</strong><br />
The first genetically modified food crop is released on the market. It remains a strongly controversial environmental issue.</p>

<p><strong>1995</strong><br />
The EEA publishes its first pan-European state of the environment report, <a href="http://reports.eea.europa.eu/92-826-5409-5/en" target="_self">the ‘Dobris’
report</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2004</strong><br />
The Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, Slovakia, Cyprus and Malta — join the EU in 2004. Romania and Bulgaria follow in 2007, bringing
the number of Member States to 27.</p>

<p><strong>2004</strong><br />
Launch of the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/etap/index_en.htm%20" target="_self">EU Environmental Technology Action Plan</a>, to promote eco-innovation. The EEA
and the European Commission launch an award-winning <a href="http://eper.ec.europa.eu/eper/%20" target="_self">European Pollutant Emission Register</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2004</strong><br />
EEA publishes the report <i><a href="http://reports.eea.europa.eu/climate_report_2_2004/en" target="_self">Impacts of Europe's changing climate</a></i>, which shows that a
clear trend exists and impacts are already being observed.</p>

<p><strong>2005</strong><br />
The <a href="http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/items/2830.php" target="_self">Kyoto Protocol</a> comes into force following ratification by Russia in 2004. As of December
2006, a total of 169 countries and other governmental entities have ratified the agreement. Notable exceptions remain the United States and Australia.</p>

<p><strong>2005</strong><br />
The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/emission.htm" target="_self">EU Emissions Trading Scheme</a> enters into effect, creating a market for carbon dioxide
allowances.</p>

<p><strong>2005</strong><br />
The UN’s <a href="http://www.maweb.org/en/index.aspx" target="_self">‘Millennium Ecosystem Assessment’</a> shows that we are depleting Earth’s natural capital at an
alarming rate.</p>

<p><strong>2005</strong><br />
EEA report <i><a href="http://reports.eea.europa.eu/eea_report_2005_1/en" target="_self">Climate change and a European low-carbon energy system</a></i> identifies possible
pathways to a low-carbon energy system in Europe by 2030.</p>

<p><strong>2005</strong><br />
EEA report <i><a href="http://www.eea.europa.eu/Highlights/20051122115248" target="_self">The European Environment — State and Outlook 2005</a></i> shows that despite many
years of Community environmental policy, environmental quality in the European Union is mixed.</p>

<p><strong>2006</strong><br />
EEA publishes the report <i><a href="http://reports.eea.europa.eu/eea_report_2006_1/en" target="_self">Using the market for cost-effective environmental policy</a></i>,
which shows a steady increase in the use of market-based instruments in Europe.</p>

<p><strong>2006</strong><br />
The documentary ‘An Inconvenient Truth’ features Al Gore, former vice-president of the US, and gives a compelling warning to halt climate change.</p>

<p><strong>2007</strong><br />

<p>Households, and the consumption patterns of the people within them, affect the environment in a myriad of ways, the most important being:</p>
<ul class="mainfont"> 
<li>energy consumption, one of the major drivers of greenhouse gas emissions and therefore climate change;
</li><li>water consumption and pollution;
</li><li>land use, with the construction of new towns and increasingly far-flung transport networks;
</li><li>the production of a wide variety of waste and through sewage treatment systems;
</li><li>the production of other pollutants, such as chemicals harmful to the ozone layer, gases which contribute to acid rain and other substances harmful to human health.
</li></ul>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike other sectors, these problems could be reduced through changing consumers habits and lifestyles, rather than introducing advanced and expensive new technologies. Unfortunately, consumption patterns have headed in the opposite direction  while Europeans may use more energy efficient appliances in their homes, for example, as a whole, their homes consume more energy than they did before.</p>
<p>Probably the most important trend can be found in Europes demographics. While Europes population is growing slowly, the number of households is growing much faster. Even if the environmental impact of each household was reduced, therefore, the sectors overall impact could remain at todays levels.</p>

					<p class="mainfont">The development of European agriculture over the 1990s presents a mixed picture as far as the environment is concerned. On the one hand, the trend towards more intensive and industrialised agriculture has continued, driving large-scale use of fertilisers, herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides, and the continued pollution of Europes waters. </p>
<p class="mainfont">As a result, some of the sectors most pressing environmental problems remain as serious now as they were a decade ago. Moreover, the increasing competition in the sector has seen some farmland abandoned and jobs lost in marginal areas  farmland now accounts for 44% of the EUs land area, down from 49% in 1980.</p>
<p class="mainfont">On the other hand, the 1990s saw a number of new trends develop, driven probably in part by public unease which was strengthened by the arrival of BSE, or mad cow disease.  The amount of land devoted to organic agriculture, for example, is growing rapidly and is expected to reach 5-10% of the EUs farmland by 2005. The agri-environment measures within the EUs Common Agricultural Policy have also been adopted more quickly than predicted.</p>
<p class="mainfont">These positive trends, however, are only a beginning: while the share of the CAPs budget which is tied to environmental improvement doubled during the 1990s, for example, it is still only 10%. The overall view is of an industry which is becoming increasingly divided between marginal areas, supported by a variety of regulations and subsidies, and areas of highly intensive and unsustainable agriculture. </p>

<p>Such a policy which

the burning of fossil fuels, an effective
measure is to reduce the use of fossil

					In 1992, the United Nations Convention on Climate Change was adopted. The most important decision under this convention was the Kyoto protocal of 1997.

<p>Achieving the Kyoto Protocol target for greenhouse gas emissions for the EU and the Member States will require substantial further emission reductions, particularly in carbon dioxide emissions. However, energy and transport demands, and the associated carbon dioxide emissions, are likely to continue to increase.

Major policy changes will be needed beyond the Kyoto target dates if sustainable development is not to be seriously jeopardised by climate change.</p>

					Vast amounts of waste and pollution end up in the seas. During the past years, public concern has led to a range of national, regional, European and international initiatives to reduce the flow of toxic chemicals into the sea and back, via the marine food chain, onto our plates.
The indicators show that these measures can turn the tide, reducing the flow into the sea of all six hazardous substances examined. The impact on living marine organisms, however, is not as clear. Moreover, there remain around another 10,000 chemicals flowing into the marine environment for which no or insufficient measures have been taken.

					Permanent grasslands are important for biodiversity and also play a major, though not always well-recognised or understood, environmental and social role.
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Permanent grasslands are found all over Europe, and as the EU's enlargement programme (especially into Eastern Europe) continues, the total amount of permanent grasslands will increase. However, the overall extent of permanent grasslands in Europe has been falling gradually for several
decades due to many factors: afforestation, intensive farming methods, development of sites for housing, etc.</p>
<p>How grassland areas evolve will depend on the implementation of a number of legal and financial instruments - which may well have conflicting objectives - and local, property-related factors may result in neighbouring farmers
taking completely different decisions affecting the grasslands within their properties.</p>
<p>The prospects for grasslands in the short and long term may, however, change quite dramatically, for example by the outbreak of diseases such as
BSE and Foot-and-Mouth and/or more rapid adoption of organic farming
methods, leading to less intensive use of land. The same pressures could instead result in more afforestation or intensive crop-farming, as dairy production declines.</p>
<p>Pressures on grassland habitats are steadily increasing: 60% of the
newly-afforested areas in the EU were previously permanent pastures of grassland; 37% was arable land, and only 3% was permanent cropland.</p>

					<p>Emissions of dangerous substances from local sources may produce far-reaching effects on the quality of soil and water, particularly groundwater, with important impacts on human and ecosystems health. </p>
<p>
A number of economic activities causing soil pollution can be clearly identified across Europe. These relate, in particular, to losses during industrial operations and waste disposal from municipal and industrial sources. Management of contaminated sites aims at assessing the impacts of contamination caused by local sources and at taking measures to satisfy environmental standards according to existing legal requirements.</p>
<p>
These indicators track the progress in the management of contaminated sites in Europe and the related expenditures from the public and private sectors. They also show the contribution of main economic activities responsible for soil contamination and the major pollutants involved.

					<p>Tourism will soon be Europes largest service industry. Europe is already the worlds favourite destination, with the sector generating up to 12% of GDP, 6% of employment, and 30% of external trade.

<p>Any industry already that large and growing that fast is going to cause environmental problems, and tourism is no exception. The industry is not just getting bigger - the way people are going on holiday is changing. The growing trend is for people to take more and shorter trips and to travel further from home. As a result, the industrys transport-related environmental problems, already significant, are expected to grow even faster than tourism itself.</p>
<p>When on holiday, moreover, people tend to consume more energy and water and produce more waste. More and more Europeans are also building second homes, which have low occupancy rates and take up far more land than other accommodation types. </p>
<p>Finally, most of these pressures are concentrated in a few small regions during a few weeks of the year, making dealing with these problems even more difficult. The Mediterranean coast, for example, is expected to see around 300 million tourists in 2025, up from 135 million in 1990.</p>

<li>We face increasing urbanisation and land abandonment.</li>

<li>Climate change is already here.</li>

<li>Progress on energy demand management is slow.</li>

<li>We are healthier, but exposure to pollutants remains.</li>

<li>We are depleting our natural resources.</li>

<li>We are losing biodiversity at an alarming rate.</li>

<li>We are increasingly exporting our environmental impacts to other continents.</li>

<p>Technology still has a vast potential to reduce environmental impacts. European policy-makers are however coming to realise that widespread behavioural changes are
required in order to move towards a sustainable society.</p>

<p>If we want to seriously address Europe’s sustainability, we need a long view, far beyond two or three legislative cycles. Climate change, globalisation and demographic
change are just a few factors that will profoundly change the context of policy-making in the future.</p>

<p>We need to take the possibility of different outcomes into account when making strategic decisions.</p>

					Biodiversity embraces the variety of genes, species and ecosystems that constitute life on Earth. We are currently witnessing a steady loss of biodiversity, with profound consequences for the natural world and for human wellbeing. The main causes are changes in natural habitats. These are due to intensive agricultural production systems, construction, quarrying, overexploitation of forests, oceans, rivers, lakes and soils, alien species invasions, pollution and — increasingly — global climate change. Europe has set a target for halting the loss of biodiversity by 2010. Recent EEA assessments show that without significant additional policy efforts, it is unlikely that the target will be reached.

<p>Humankind is itself a part of biodiversity, and our existence would
be impossible without it. Quality of life, economic competitiveness,
employment and security all rely on this natural capital. Biodiversity
is crucial to 'ecosystem services', i.e. the services that nature
supplies: climate regulation, water and air, soil fertility, and the
production of food, fuel, fibre and medicines. It is essential for
maintaining the long-term viability of agriculture and fisheries, and
is the basis of many industrial processes and the production of new
medicines.</p>

<p>In Europe, human activity has shaped biodiversity ever since the
spread of agriculture and animal husbandry over 5 000 years ago. The
agricultural and industrial revolutions led to dramatic and
accelerating changes in land use, intensification of agriculture,
urbanisation and land abandonment. This in turn has resulted in the
collapse of many practices (e.g. traditional agricultural methods) that
helped to maintain biodiversity-rich landscapes.</p>

<p>Europe's high per capita consumption and waste production means that
our impact on ecosystems extends well beyond our continent. European
lifestyles rely heavily on the import of resources and goods from all
over the world, often encouraging unsustainable exploitation of natural
resources. This leads to loss of biodiversity which in turn damages the
natural capital resources on which social and economic development is
based.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There can be no purpose more enspiriting than to begin the age of
restoration, reweaving the wondrous diversity of life that still
surrounds us.</p>

<p class="source">Edward O. Wilson, 'The Diversity of Life', 1992</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Biodiversity loss is inextricably linked to the degradation of
ecosystem services that support life on earth. The 2005 <a
href="http://www.maweb.org/">Millennium Ecosystem Assessment</a>
assessed 24 ecosystem services globally, and found that 15 of those
have been degraded, affecting fisheries, timber production, water
supply, waste treatment and detoxification, water purification, natural
hazard protection and regulation of air quality. The EEA’s <a

<p><strong>Over the past decades, environmental information has evolved

<h2>A long-term view requires a broad mind</h2>

<p>Forward-looking studies have been developed for agriculture,

more integrated, long-term assessments to effectively support strategic
decision-making. We also need to broaden our impact assessments

in 2035.</p>

<h2>Better and more detailed environmental information</h2>

<p>Environmental information is currently collected by a variety of
organisations using techniques from satellite observation to mobile

<h2 class="Heading">EU policies</h2>

<p>In its <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/">2001 Strategy for Sustainable Development</a>, the EU set itself the target to halt the loss of biodiversity and
restore habitats and natural systems by 2010. The European Commission's <a
href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/biodiversity/current_biodiversity_policy/biodiversity_com_2006/index_en.htm">2006 Biodiversity Communication</a> provides the
main policy framework. It adds much-needed momentum to the 2010 target, articulates the responsibilities of EU institutions and Member States and sets out an ambitious
policy approach and Action Plan proposing concrete measures.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While climate change takes up much of the media attention, in one fundamental way biodiversity loss is an even more serious threat. This is because the degradation of
ecosystems often reaches a point of no return — and because extinction is forever.</p>

<p>EU nature conservation policy is based on two main pieces of legislation:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/nature_conservation/eu_nature_legislation/birds_directive/index_en.htm">Birds
Directive</a> and</div>
</li>

<li>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/nature_conservation/eu_nature_legislation/habitats_directive/index_en.htm">Habitats
Directive</a></div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Both directives provide the basis for the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/home.htm">Natura 2000 network</a>, a network of nature reserves which extends
across the Union to safeguard species and habitats of special European interest. EU nature conservation policy benefits from a specific financial instrument, the <a
href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/nature_conservation/natura_2000_network/managing_natura_2000/exchange_of_good_practice/life.html">LIFE-Nature fund</a>.</p>

<p>Biodiversity loss is caused mainly by sectoral activities. The 1998 <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/docum/9842sm.htm">European Community Biodiversity
Strategy</a> focuses specifically on the integration of biodiversity concerns into sectoral policies, including conservation of natural resources, agriculture, fisheries,
regional policies and spatial planning, forests, energy and transport, tourism, development and economic co-operation.</p>

<p>Other policies relevant to biodiversity at EU level include:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/newprg/index.htm">EU Sixth Environmental Action Programme 'Our future, our choice', adopted
in 2002</a>, in which conservation of biodiversity is one of the four main issues to be tackled.</li>

<li style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">The 2004 <a
href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/biodiversity/develop_biodiversity_policy/malahide_conference/index_en.htm">'Message from Malahide'</a>, presenting 18 priority
objectives for halting the loss of biodiversity, many of which relate to sectoral integration of biodiversity issues.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="Heading">Pan-European and global biodiversity policies</h2>

<p>In 1992, the UN <a href="http://www.cbd.int/default.shtml">Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)</a> marked the international community's commitment to addressing
biodiversity loss. In response, the <a href="http://www.peblds.org/">Pan‑European Biological and Landscape Diversity Strategy</a> was endorsed by the countries covered by
the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. Embedded in the ministerial 'Environment for Europe' process, this strategy provides the only platform for pan-European
cooperation on tackling biodiversity loss.</p>

<p>In 2002, the CBD and the Johannesburg Summit on Sustainable Development endorsed a 2010 global target to significantly reduce the current rate of biodiversity loss by
2010. In 2003, pan‑European environment ministers agreed to halt the loss of biodiversity by 2010 in the Kiev Resolution on Biodiversity.</p>

<p>The CBD establishes a national-level obligation for biodiversity planning. Countries must develop national strategies which reflect how the Convention's objectives are
to be achieved, and related action plans must set out the steps to be taken towards these goals. A list of these national biodiversity strategies and action plans is
available on the <a href="http://www.cbd.int/nbsap/default.shtml">CBD website</a>.</p>

<p>In 2002, the CBD and the Johannesburg Summit on Sustainable Development endorsed a 2010 global target to significantly reduce the current rate of biodiversity loss by
2010. In 2003, pan‑European environment ministers agreed to halt the loss of biodiversity by 2010 in the Kiev Resolution on Biodiversity.</p>

<p>The CBD establishes a national-level obligation for biodiversity planning. Countries must develop national strategies which reflect how the Convention's objectives are
to be achieved, and related action plans must set out the steps to be taken towards these goals. A list of these national biodiversity strategies and action plans is
available on the <a href="http://www.cbd.int/nbsap/default.shtml">CBD website</a>.</p>

					Climate change is one of our greatest environmental, social and economic threats. The warming of the climate system is unequivocal, says the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Observations show increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global mean sea level. It is very likely that most of the warming can be attributed to the emissions of greenhouse gases by human activities.

<p>Over the past 150 years, mean temperature has increased by almost 0.8 ºC globally and by about 1 ºC in Europe. Eleven of the last twelve years (1995–2006) rank among the 12 warmest years in the instrumental record of global surface temperature (since 1850). Without global action to limit emissions, the <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/">IPCC</a> expects that global temperatures may increase further by 1.8 to 4.0 ºC by 2100. This means that temperature increase since pre-industrial times would exceed 2 °C. Beyond this threshold irreversible and possibly catastrophic changes become far more likely. (<a href="http://www.greenfacts.org/en/climate-change-ar4/index.htm#4">More information</a>)</p>
<p>The <a href="http://reports.eea.europa.eu/climate_report_2_2004/en">impacts of climate change</a> are already being observed and are projected to become more pronounced. Extreme weather events, including heat waves, droughts and floods, are expected to become more frequent and intense. In Europe the largest temperature increases are in southern Europe and the Arctic region. Precipitation decreases in southern Europe and increases in the north/north-west. This leads to impacts on natural ecosystems, human health and water resources. Economic sectors, such as forestry, agriculture, tourism and buildings will suffer mostly adverse consequences. The agricultural sector in northern Europe may benefit from a limited temperature rise.</p>
<p>To halt climate change, global greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced significantly, and <a title="Policy context" href="resolveuid/24fa6c01bc4777ed4b83d41dafb73098">policies</a> are put in place to do so.</p>
<p>The main sources of man-made greenhouse gases are:</p>
<ul type="square"><li style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">burning of fossil fuels in electricity generation, transport, industry and households;</li><li style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">agriculture and land use changes like deforestation;</li><li style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">land filling of waste; and</li><li style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">use of industrial fluorinated gases.</li></ul>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if policies and efforts to reduce emissions are effective, some climate change is inevitable. We must therefore also develop strategies and actions to adapt to the impacts of climate change in Europe and especially beyond, since the least developed countries are among the most vulnerable, having the least financial and technical capacity to adapt.</p>

</blockquote>
<h2 class="Heading">Global policies</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://unfccc.int/2860.php">UNFCCC</a> long-term objective is '<strong>to stabilise atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system</strong><em>'</em>. The <a href="http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/background/items/2878.php">Kyoto Protocol</a> is a first step to achieve this. It sets emission reduction targets for many industrialised countries, including most EU Member States, and limits the emission increases of the remaining countries:</p>
<ul><li style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">The 15 older EU Member States have a joint emission reduction target of 8 % below 1990 levels by 2008–2012 below 1990 levels (<a class="external-link" href="multimedia/europe-leads-the-fight-against-climate-change/view">video</a>). Through an internal EU agreement some EU Member States are allowed increases in emissions, while others should decrease emissions.</li><li style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">Most new Member States have targets of – 6 to – 8 % from their base years (mostly 1990).<br /></li></ul>
<p>The United States of America, which have high greenhouse gas emissions, have not ratified the Protocol.</p>
<p>Countries are expected to meet their target mainly through domestic policies and measures. They are allowed to meet part of their emission reduction targets by investing in emission reducing projects in developing countries (<a href="http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/mechanisms/clean_development_mechanism/items/2718.php">Clean Developing Mechanism</a>, CDM) or in developed ones (<a href="http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/mechanisms/joint_implementation/items/1674.php">Joint Implementation</a>). The CDM is also meant to support sustainable development, e.g. by financing renewable energy projects.</p>
<p>The IPCC calls for global emission reductions of about 50 % by the middle of the 21st century. This implies 60–80 % reduction of emissions by developed countries. Developing countries with large emissions, such as China, India and Brazil, will have to limit their emission growth.</p>
<p>A post-2012 international agreement is being negotiated within the UNFCCC. The aim is to reach an agreement at the climate conference planned in Copenhagen for December 2009.</p>
<h2 class="Heading">European Union policies</h2>
<p>Many European countries have adopted national programmes aimed at reducing emissions. Various policies and measures have also been adopted at the EU level through the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/eccp.htm">European Climate Change Programme</a>, for example:</p>
<ul><li style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">increased use of renewable energy (wind, solar, biomass) and combined heat and power installations;</li><li style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">improvements in energy efficiency in e.g. buildings, industry, household appliances;</li><li style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from new passenger cars;</li><li style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">abatement measures in manufacturing industry;</li><li style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">measures to reduce emissions from landfills.</li></ul>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>The EU's carbon dioxide <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/emission.htm">Emission Trading Scheme</a> (<a class="external-link" href="multimedia/emissions-trading-putting-a-price-on-carbon/view">video</a>) is the cornerstone of EU efforts to reduce emissions cost-effectively. In March 2007, the EU leaders endorsed an ambitious <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52007DC0002:EN:NOT">climate change and energy plan</a> to limit EU greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20 % by 2020 (from 1990 levels) and achieve, by 2020, a target of 20 % of total EU primary energy use through renewable energy. In January 2008, the European Commission proposed a new <a class="external-link" href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/climate_action.htm">energy and climate package </a>to achieve emission reduction target (<a class="external-link" href="http://www.tvlink.org/viewer.cfm?vidID=275&amp;amp;strID=207">video</a>). Various sectors like agriculture, transport and construction and all Member States will have to play their role and contribute to Europe's targets according to their respective financial capacities. For energy-intensive sectors, such as steel and chemicals, the Commission proposes to strengthen the EU's Emissions Trading System to help reach the 20% objective. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions will require an increased use of renewable energies, which also implies a more diversified energy supply for Europe.</p>
<p>New policy areas for which additional emission reductions measures are being developed include aviation (<a class="external-link" href="multimedia/reducing-climate-impacts-from-international-aviation-europe-leads-the-way/view">video</a>), CO<sub>2</sub> and cars&amp;nbsp; (<a class="external-link" href="../transport/multimedia/curbing-co2-emissions-from-road-transport/view">video</a>), and carbon capture and storage (<a class="external-link" href="multimedia/capturing-carbon-a-new-front-in-the-fight-against-climate-change/view">video</a>) .</p>
<p>Some EEA member countries have prepared National Climate Change Adaptation Strategies or have started preparing these. The European Commission’s 2007 <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/adaptation/index_en.htm">Green Paper on 'Adapting to climate change in Europe — options for EU action</a>' is currently under stakeholder consultation.</p>

<ul><li style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">The 15 older EU Member States have a joint emission reduction target of 8 % below 1990 levels by 2008–2012 below 1990 levels (<a class="external-link" href="multimedia/europe-leads-the-fight-against-climate-change/view">video</a>). Through an internal EU agreement some EU Member States are allowed increases in emissions, while others should decrease emissions.</li><li style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">Most new Member States have targets of – 6 to – 8 % from their base years (mostly 1990).<br /></li></ul>
<p>The United States of America, which have high greenhouse gas emissions, have not ratified the Protocol.</p>
<p>Countries are expected to meet their target mainly through domestic policies and measures. They are allowed to meet part of their emission reduction targets by investing in emission reducing projects in developing countries (<a href="http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/mechanisms/clean_development_mechanism/items/2718.php">Clean Developing Mechanism</a>, CDM) or in developed ones (<a href="http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/mechanisms/joint_implementation/items/1674.php">Joint Implementation</a>). The CDM is also meant to support sustainable development, e.g. by financing renewable energy projects.</p>
<p>The IPCC calls for global emission reductions of about 50 % by the middle of the 21st century. This implies 60–80 % reduction of emissions by developed countries. Developing countries with large emissions, such as China, India and Brazil, will have to limit their emission growth.</p>
<p>A post-2012 international agreement is being negotiated within the UNFCCC. The aim is to reach an agreement at the climate conference planned in Copenhagen for December 2009.</p>
<h2 class="Heading">European Union policies</h2>
<p>Many European countries have adopted national programmes aimed at reducing emissions. Various policies and measures have also been adopted at the EU level through the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/eccp.htm">European Climate Change Programme</a>, for example:</p>
<ul><li style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">increased use of renewable energy (wind, solar, biomass) and combined heat and power installations;</li><li style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">improvements in energy efficiency in e.g. buildings, industry, household appliances;</li><li style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from new passenger cars;</li><li style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">abatement measures in manufacturing industry;</li><li style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">measures to reduce emissions from landfills.</li></ul>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>The EU's carbon dioxide <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/emission.htm">Emission Trading Scheme</a> (<a class="external-link" href="multimedia/emissions-trading-putting-a-price-on-carbon/view">video</a>) is the cornerstone of EU efforts to reduce emissions cost-effectively. In March 2007, the EU leaders endorsed an ambitious <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52007DC0002:EN:NOT">climate change and energy plan</a> to limit EU greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20 % by 2020 (from 1990 levels) and achieve, by 2020, a target of 20 % of total EU primary energy use through renewable energy. In January 2008, the European Commission proposed a new <a class="external-link" href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/climate_action.htm">energy and climate package </a>to achieve emission reduction target (<a class="external-link" href="http://www.tvlink.org/viewer.cfm?vidID=275&amp;amp;strID=207">video</a>). Various sectors like agriculture, transport and construction and all Member States will have to play their role and contribute to Europe's targets according to their respective financial capacities. For energy-intensive sectors, such as steel and chemicals, the Commission proposes to strengthen the EU's Emissions Trading System to help reach the 20% objective. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions will require an increased use of renewable energies, which also implies a more diversified energy supply for Europe.</p>
<p>New policy areas for which additional emission reductions measures are being developed include aviation (<a class="external-link" href="multimedia/reducing-climate-impacts-from-international-aviation-europe-leads-the-way/view">video</a>), CO<sub>2</sub> and cars&amp;nbsp; (<a class="external-link" href="../transport/multimedia/curbing-co2-emissions-from-road-transport/view">video</a>), and carbon capture and storage (<a class="external-link" href="multimedia/capturing-carbon-a-new-front-in-the-fight-against-climate-change/view">video</a>) .</p>
<p>Some EEA member countries have prepared National Climate Change Adaptation Strategies or have started preparing these. The European Commission’s 2007 <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/adaptation/index_en.htm">Green Paper on 'Adapting to climate change in Europe — options for EU action</a>' is currently under stakeholder consultation.</p>

					Problems like climate change, biodiversity loss and natural resource use have long-term implications which require long-term policy solutions. To make informed strategic decisions, we must try to anticipate what lies ahead and grasp ongoing, emerging and latent developments. If we want to seriously address Europe's sustainability, we have to look beyond two legislative cycles and more. However, a long view requires a broad mind: the key challenges facing Europe can change significantly with time. Environmental scenarios, outlooks and other types of forward studies help us to address discontinuity and uncertainties of future developments and to design robust policies that can withstand the test of time.

					Energy gives personal comfort and mobility to people, and is essential for the generation of industrial, commercial and societal wealth. On the other hand, energy production and consumption place considerable pressures on the environment (including heat and electricity production, oil refining and its final use in households, services, industry and transport). These pressures include the emission of greenhouse gases and air pollutants, land-use, waste generation and oil spills. They contribute to climate change, damage natural ecosystems and the man-made environment, and cause adverse effects to human health.

<p>The combustion
of fossil fuels from human activities is largely responsible for the increase
in carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations in the atmosphere together
with the resulting increase in global temperature and <a title="Climate change" class="internal-link" href="resolveuid/6723e6872d33d022a07eeae0e235ac48">climate change</a>.
The increasing demand for energy results in the accumulation of CO<sub>2</sub>,
the most important greenhouse gas, because of the way energy is produced. Most
countries rely on fossil fuels (oil, gas and coal) to satisfy their energy
demand. These fuels need to be burned so that the heat released in the process
can be converted to energy. The carbon in the fuel reacts with oxygen,
producing CO<sub>2</sub> that is released to the atmosphere. Air pollutants
(sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulates) are also released, with
resulting impacts on air quality. However, due to technical measures and
improvements in power and heat generation plants, emissions of air pollutants
have been declining over the past decades.</p>
<p>The economy continues
to grow as does energy consumption. Fossil fuels still dominate the fuel mix — about
79&amp;nbsp;% of the energy needs of the average European are met by coal, gas and
oil. Around 13&amp;nbsp;% comes from nuclear power and the remaining 8&amp;nbsp;% comes
from rapidly increasing renewable energy sources (especially wind and solar
energy).</p>
The average
European uses the equivalent of 3.7&amp;nbsp;tonnes of oil per year on electricity,
heating and transport. This corresponds to 7.8&amp;nbsp;tonnes of energy-related CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions. This varies widely between countries, depending partly on the uptake
of renewable energy sources. Transport has been the fastest-growing energy-using
sector since 1990 and is now the largest consumer of <a title="Energy" class="internal-link" href="resolveuid/3cdc3686b331e7d580f9ade779c72ad9">energy</a>.

<p>Activities such as agriculture, forestry, transport and housing use land and alter its natural state and functions. Many environmental problems are rooted in the use of land; it leads to climate change, biodiversity loss and the pollution of water, soils and air.<strong> </strong>The impacts can be direct, e.g. the destruction of natural habitats and landscapes, or indirect, e.g. soil-sealing and deforestation enhancing flood risks. Climate change leads to desertification, changes in land cover and flash floods, amongst others.</p>
<p>With 75 % of Europe's population living in cities, urban land-use issues are currently of key importance. However, management of agricultural land and its multiple functions — food production, nature conservation, leisure and housing — is equally important. The increased land-take for <a href="resolveuid/e1a9f122c53c04739892f0e81a902989">urbanisation</a> occurs mainly at the expense of agricultural land.<strong> </strong>During 1990–2000, of all areas converted to artificial land-use, 48 % were arable land or under permanent crops and 36 % were pasture or mixed farmland. Growth in <a title="Transport" class="internal-link" href="resolveuid/ca85d70438bcda31f0014606bced7455">transport</a> has boosted <a class="external-link" href="../transport/multimedia/interview-with-peder/view">land-take by transport infrastructure</a>.</p>
<p>Mountains and uplands, the water tanks of Europe, are being abandoned by traditional users such as shepherds, to be replaced by skiers. Forest management has had to adapt to the global economic demand for timber production.</p>
<p>Coasts are being converted to man-made artificial surfaces at an even faster pace. Population sizes along Europe's coasts are continuously increasing, sometimes even faster than in inland areas. Tourism appears to be the most important maritime activity especially in southern countries and also those on the Baltic Sea, such as Poland and Finland. This activity has a very high spatial and seasonal impact; tourism flows affect the whole of Europe.</p>
<p>Coasts are being urbanised at an accelerating speed. Population densities in coastal regions are, on average, 10 % higher than their inland equivalent. The conversion of natural areas on the coast to artificial surfaces is growing at an even faster rate than population density. Housing (mostly secondary housing in many areas), services, recreation and transport infrastructure are the main causes.</p>

					For the first time in human history, more people are living in towns and cities than in rural areas. Europe is one of the most urbanised continents. Approximately 75 % of its population lives in urban areas; by 2020, this will be 80 %. As a result, the demand for land in and around cities is becoming acute; urban sprawl is re-shaping landscapes and affecting people's quality of life and the environment as never before. Urban planning and management have risen high on the political agenda, with transport and housing as crucial challenges.

<p>Urban development has a strong European dimension. Cities interact with and influence the surrounding land, thus affecting the environment of a much broader area. Their development is also driven by external factors such as demographic change, the need for mobility, globalisation and climate change. Decreasing household sizes and an ageing population are expected to enhance environmental pressures over the next decades. The further development of information, communication services and technology brings new important qualitative changes to urban systems.</p>
<p>Cities and towns act as engines for progress, often driving much of our cultural, intellectual, educational and technological achievements and innovations. However, today's trend of new, low-density approaches to urban development results in increased consumption of energy, resources, transport and land, thereby raising greenhouse gas emissions and air and noise pollution to levels that often exceed the legal or recommended human safety limits.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Overall consumption, energy use, water use and waste generation go along with a growing number of urban households. The EEA's <a href="http://reports.eea.europa.eu/eea_report_2006_10/en">report on urban sprawl</a> shows that more than a quarter of the European Union's territory has been directly affected by urban land use: between 1990 and 2000 an area five times that of Greater London has been consigned to urban sprawl. This has primarily occurred on former agricultural land, resulting in the loss of important ecosystem services, such as food production, flood protection and biological diversity.</p>

					Concern for future generations is a key prerequisite of sustainable development policies at global, European, national and local levels. Long-term policy objectives are at the heart of many international conventions and protocols that address problems of global environmental change. Long-term policy objectives also underpin key environmental policies of the European Union and its Member States. Scenarios support strategic planning and decision-making, and can help to test the implications and robustness of different policies. Equally important, they allow for profound stakeholder participation, enabling the representation of conflicting opinions and world views.

<h2>Global level</h2>
<p>Environmental governance benefits from a dense web of international agreements and institutions. The most prominent long-term environmental policy frameworks are the <a href="http://unfccc.int/2860.php">United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</a> (UNFCCC), the Convention on Biodiversity and the Millennium Development Goals. Mid- to long-term policy objectives underpin various international environmental conventions, for example the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and its Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer and the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs).</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<h2>European level</h2>
<p>The <a class="external-link" href="http://ec.europa.eu/sustainable/welcome/index_en.htm">European Union's Sustainable Development Strategy</a>&amp;nbsp;(SDS) sets out a plan to consistently tackle seven key mid- to long-term challenges of sustainable development, such as climate change, clean energy and sustainable transport and sustainable consumption and production. A number of European directives explicitly follow long-term objectives, especially in the area of climate change and energy policy. Similar developments can be observed in the EU Member States — several have institutionalised foresight programmes within their national administrations.</p>
<p>Long-term planning is less advanced in South Eastern Europe and the countries of Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia, where the focus is more on reforming environmental policies, laws and regulations and strengthening compliance. However, initiatives are underway, to help avoid conflicts around scarce natural resources and also to support overall sustainable use and protection of natural resources (see the examples provided in the <a class="external-link" href="http://scenarios.ew.eea.europa.eu/fol585720/overview-available-forward-looking-studies">overview</a> of forward-looking studies).</p>

<p>In 1999, the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/forum/spatreport_en.pdf">European Spatial Development Perspective</a> (ESDP) resulted in European policy orientations for territorial balance and cohesion, improved competitiveness, access to markets and knowledge, as well as wiser management of natural and cultural resources.

					Sustainable urban development figures prominently in the EU's policies on environment, regional development, health and transport. Legislation, such as the ambient air quality and environmental noise directives, also targets cities. With its policies, the EU aims to strengthen the responsibilities of cities on the basis of the subsidiarity principle, which requires that matters are handled by the lowest competent level. The local and the European levels become, however, more and more interwoven, as do environmental, social and economic issues. Europe's future urban policy therefore has to find ways for more integrated and effective management between the various policy levels.

					<p>Over the last ten years new economic and social trends have changed our personal patterns of consumption in ways that are having direct and indirect impacts on the environment.</p><p>Economic growth and globalisation, fewer people living in a household, the ageing population, technological breakthroughs such as mobile phones and the internet, and our growing desire for ownership and personal freedom, are all contributing to a rise in household consumption. </p><p>Our increased use of energy and materials is depleting natural resources, causing pollution and climate change through the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs), and creating more and more waste. </p><p>Although there have been advances in making technologies for our homes and our cars more efficient, these have been counteracted by the steady rise in energy consumption, for example in the number of car and plane kilometres that we travel.</p><p>Natural resources such as sand, wood and especially land are under pressure because we are replacing our existing houses with new and larger ones.</p><p>Because much of what we consume comes from outside Europe, we have a global responsibility not to damage the environment, and to find ways of making our consumption patterns more sustainable.</p><p>These are some facts about household consumption:</p>
<h2>Food and drink</h2>
<ul>
<li>In the 1960s an average European grocery had 2,000 product lines. A modern supermarket has more than 15,000.</li>
<li>The consumption of bottled water per person increased in all European countries during the 1990s. Mineral water has to be transported long distances and generates large amounts of packaging waste.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Household</h2>
<ul>
<li>Between 1990 and 2002, household consumption expenditure in the EU15 Member States increased by almost a third to over 12,000 Euros per person on average.</li>
<li>Households are one of the largest energy consumers in the EU, accounting for 26.2% of total energy consumption in 2001, compared with 27.7% for industrial use.</li>
<li>Space heating is by far the largest household energy end-use in the EU (70%), followed by water heating (14%) and electric appliances and lighting (12%).</li>
<li>Water metering has contributed to cutting household water use to less than 25% of total water use in Europe.</li>
<li>Every year we produce around 5.5-7 million tonnes of electronic waste - computers, mobile phones, TVs and other electronic devices - and this figure is increasing by 3-5% annually. Disposal of electronic waste leads to serious hazards from carcinogenic substances which can leach through to soil and groundwater.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Travel and tourism</h2>
<ul>
<li>Passenger cars have generally become more energy-efficient, but the growth in transport demand and the increased use of heavy and relatively fuel-inefficient cars such as sport utility vehicles (SUVs) have outweighed these improvements. Greenhouse gas emissions from transport have increased by about 20% in the past decade.</li>
<li>The number of households with two or more cars is on the increase, though approximately a quarter of EU households have none.</li>
<li>Around half of all passenger trips by car are less than 6 kilometres.</li>
<li>People are taking more and more trips by plane, with correspondingly higher fuel consumption and emissions. During the period 2000 to 2030 the share of air travel in Europe is projected to increase from 5.5% to 10.5%, while public transports share will fall from 9% to 6.5%.</li>
<li>The building of new roads has fragmented natural habitats and so affected biodiversity. Noise from traffic is also a problem across Europe.</li>
<li>Between 1990 and 1998, 10 hectares were taken every day for motorway construction in the EU.</li>

					<h2>Environmental threats to human health</h2>
<p>We now have strong evidence of links between air pollution and our health. Chemicals, artificial hormone-like substances, gases and particulate matter from fossil fuel burning and industrial processes, are in our air, water and soil, and it is widely believed that they are damaging peoples respiratory and cardiovascular systems, hormone functions and brain development. </p><p>Children are particularly affected by environment-related pollution. It makes their asthma symptoms worse and means that they are more vulnerable to certain types of cancer and brain disorders. </p>
<div class="linkbox"><div class="linkhref"><a href="resolveuid/baf2d32f877eefad3743ad0f14786deb" alt="Cancer in children">Cancer in children</a></div><div class="linkdesc">Section that examines how children are particularly affected by cancer.</div></div>
<p>Climate change, caused by emissions of greenhouse gases, is a clear risk to our health, with the increased likelihood of intense heatwaves, hot climate diseases, violent storms, floods and droughts. </p>
<div class="linkbox"><div class="linkhref"><a href="resolveuid/4fc643af9cb2ab405310ca4739e074da" alt="Implications of climate change">Implications of climate change</a></div><div class="linkdesc">How climate change has and will affect our health</div></div>
<p>Although in some cases the links between certain pollutants and health problems are beyond doubt, in others we dont have conclusive proof, because of the complexity of separating out all the different factors of age, gender, genetic make-up, geographical location, diet, even peoples income and education level.  </p><p>Another difficulty is time: a persons health needs to be studied over their whole life cycle.  We may find that the combined long-term and cumulative exposure to chemicals and pollutants in food, air, water and consumer products will constitute a new risk - the cocktail effect.</p><p>These are some key facts about the environment and health:</p>
<ul>
<li>Air pollution is the environmental factor with the greatest impact on health in Europe.</li>
<li>The air pollutants that affect the respiratory system are ozone, nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, and particulate matter.</li>
<li>20 million Europeans suffer from respiratory problems.</li>
<li>In Europe, the cost to society of asthma has been estimated at 3 thousand million Euros per year.</li>
<li>Allergic disorders including asthma are relatively less common in Eastern Europe, despite levels of many air pollutants being higher there than in Western Europe.</li>
<li>Asthma is now the most common respiratory disease in western European children. On average, 7% of European children aged 4-10 have problems with asthma.</li>
<li>Research shows that children who grow up in areas with atmospheric pollution are twice as likely to develop reduced lung function when they grow up as children from rural areas.</li>
<li>Respiratory health improves when air quality improves. When changes were made in transport and community behaviour during the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, hospital admissions of children with acute asthma symptoms fell by 41.6% during the period of the games.</li>
<li>The naturally occurring radioactive gas radon is responsible for 21,000 cases of lung cancers per year in the USA, and around 9,000 cases per year in Europe.</li>
<li>Approximately 80-90% of all skin cancers can be related to ultra-violet (UV) radiation from the sun.</li>
<li>Environmental pollution may have an effect on gender ratios. After the explosion in the chemical plant at Seveso in Italy in 1976 which spread dioxin over the surrounding area, 48 girls and 26 boys were born to the most exposed families during the 7 subsequent years.</li>
<li>Human sperm quality has declined markedly over the past 50 years, a phenomenon that may be related to chemicals, pesticides and/or natural hormone-like substances in the environment.</li>
<li>Climate change means that intense summer heat is becoming more common. The summer heat waves of 2003 resulted in more than 20,000 excess deaths in Europe.</li>
<li>Increasingly heavy rainfall is making flash floods more common.</li>

					<h2>Environmental threats to human health</h2>
<p>We now have strong evidence of links between air pollution and our health. Chemicals, artificial hormone-like substances, gases and particulate matter from fossil fuel burning and industrial processes, are in our air, water and soil, and it is widely believed that they are damaging peoples respiratory and cardiovascular systems, hormone functions and brain development. </p><p>Children are particularly affected by environment-related pollution. It makes their asthma symptoms worse and means that they are more vulnerable to certain types of cancer and brain disorders. </p>

<p>Climate change, caused by emissions of greenhouse gases, is a clear risk to our health, with the increased likelihood of intense heatwaves, hot climate diseases, violent storms, floods and droughts. </p>
<div class="linkbox"><div class="linkhref"><a href="resolveuid/4fc643af9cb2ab405310ca4739e074da" alt="Implications of climate change">Implications of climate change</a></div><div class="linkdesc">How climate change has and will affect our health</div></div>
<p>Although in some cases the links between certain pollutants and health problems are beyond doubt, in others we dont have conclusive proof, because of the complexity of separating out all the different factors of age, gender, genetic make-up, geographical location, diet, even peoples income and education level.  </p><p>Another difficulty is time: a persons health needs to be studied over their whole life cycle.  We may find that the combined long-term and cumulative exposure to chemicals and pollutants in food, air, water and consumer products will constitute a new risk - the cocktail effect.</p><p>These are some key facts about the environment and health:</p>
<ul>
<li>Air pollution is the environmental factor with the greatest impact on health in Europe.</li>
<li>The air pollutants that affect the respiratory system are ozone, nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, and particulate matter.</li>
<li>20 million Europeans suffer from respiratory problems.</li>
<li>In Europe, the cost to society of asthma has been estimated at 3 thousand million Euros per year.</li>
<li>Allergic disorders including asthma are relatively less common in Eastern Europe, despite levels of many air pollutants being higher there than in Western Europe.</li>
<li>Asthma is now the most common respiratory disease in western European children. On average, 7% of European children aged 4-10 have problems with asthma.</li>
<li>Research shows that children who grow up in areas with atmospheric pollution are twice as likely to develop reduced lung function when they grow up as children from rural areas.</li>
<li>Respiratory health improves when air quality improves. When changes were made in transport and community behaviour during the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, hospital admissions of children with acute asthma symptoms fell by 41.6% during the period of the games.</li>
<li>The naturally occurring radioactive gas radon is responsible for 21,000 cases of lung cancers per year in the USA, and around 9,000 cases per year in Europe.</li>
<li>Approximately 80-90% of all skin cancers can be related to ultra-violet (UV) radiation from the sun.</li>
<li>Environmental pollution may have an effect on gender ratios. After the explosion in the chemical plant at Seveso in Italy in 1976 which spread dioxin over the surrounding area, 48 girls and 26 boys were born to the most exposed families during the 7 subsequent years.</li>
<li>Human sperm quality has declined markedly over the past 50 years, a phenomenon that may be related to chemicals, pesticides and/or natural hormone-like substances in the environment.</li>
<li>Climate change means that intense summer heat is becoming more common. The summer heat waves of 2003 resulted in more than 20,000 excess deaths in Europe.</li>
<li>Increasingly heavy rainfall is making flash floods more common.</li>
<li>We are likely to see more frequent droughts which will decrease the water supply and so increase the risk of water and food-borne diseases.</li>
<li>With rising temperatures, tick-borne diseases have been reaching epidemic proportions in many parts of Europe, and localised outbreaks of malaria are expected.</li>
<li>Wildlife health provides warning signs of how humans may be affected by environmental pollution. For example, marine predators such as seals, whales, dolphins and polar bears have been shown to have high levels of pollutant residues in their bodies that have been obtained through the food chain and are causing infertility, immunodeficiency and tissue malformation.</li>
<li>Pharmaceuticals can affect wildlife as well as humans. Populations of vultures in India and Pakistan have declined by more than 95% since 1997 as a result of exposure to diclofenac, a widely-used painkiller and anti-inflammatory drug. The birds are exposed to the drug when they feed on the carcasses of farm animals which have been treated with the drug.</li>

					<h2>Resource consumption in perspective</h2>
<p>We use natural resources in many of our daily activities - by eating, drinking, wearing clothes, using our electric and electronic appliances, heating and lighting our homes, and driving our cars. But what are the effects of our consumption? And can we go on consuming at our current rate?</p><p>The uncomfortable reality is that the wealthier our societies become, and the more of us there are, the more resources we use and the greater the pressures on our environment.</p><p>One obvious problem is the environments capacity to go on providing the resources we need. The Earth is a closed materials system and although some materials such as forests and fish are renewable, others such as metals, oil and land, are not. </p><p>Another issue is the environments ability to absorb the effects of our consumption - the discharge of chemical pollutants and harmful emissions. For example, the greenhouse gases given off from the burning of fossil fuels are already changing our climate.  </p><p>What we need to do is break the link between economic growth and increased pressures on the environment. In the last twenty years many EU countries have started using resources more efficiently, but our overall consumption has not decreased. </p><p>If future generations are to inherit a world where there is enough to go round and which has not been environmentally degraded, we may have to take radical action to change our lifestyles and consumption behaviour.</p><p>Here are some facts about the sustainable use and management of natural resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over the next fifty years the total consumption of natural resources by the world population is projected to be between double and five times what it is now.</li>
<li>The global population is expected to grow by 50% over the next 50 years.</li>
<li>In the 2nd half of the 20th century, global trade volumes grew by a factor of 6 to 8 for raw materials and as much as 40 for manufactured goods.</li>
<li>Current materials consumption in industrialised countries is between 31 and 74 tonnes per person per year.</li>
<li>Most of the energy we use in Europe comes from fossil fuels. Each year almost 4 tonnes are consumed per person in the 15 original member countries of the EU and about half that is imported.</li>
<li>However, fossil fuel-related emissions of air pollutants have come down over the last ten years, thanks to the use of cleaning up equipment.</li>
<li>Estimates show that the mid-depletion point of worldwide crude oil reserves could be reached within the next 10-20 years.</li>
<li>Extraction of metals leads to contamination of soils and destruction of landscape, harm to biodiversity and natural water cycles, high energy consumption and the largest waste stream in Europe.</li>
<li>Extraction of construction minerals (sand, gravel, clay, limestone and natural stones) causes noise and air pollution on top of most of the problems encountered with the extraction of metals.</li>
<li>Water resources are under threat from increasing population, intensive agriculture, rapid urbanisation, growing tourism and leisure activities, and the lack of proper supply and treatment facilities.</li>
<li>It takes approximately 1,000 litres of water to produce 1 kg of wheat; 2,700 litres of water to produce 1 kg of eggs; 13,500 litres of water to produce 1 kg of beef</li>
<li>If the entire global population were to adopt a western-style diet, about 75% more water would be needed for food production.</li>
<li>Considerable progress has been made in reducing industrial and urban chemical discharges, and contamination of drinking and bathing water is now largely under control.</li>
<li>The picture is less positive with agriculture, however, and high concentrations of pesticides and heavy metals can still be found in many European waters.</li>
<li>The seas around Europe provide about 10% of the worlds fish catches, but many of our stocks are now considered to be in a critical state because of over-fishing.</li>
<li>In most European countries forest area is increasing on average by about half a million hectares a year.</li>
<li>Tree and soil quality have improved to a certain extent because of the decrease in atmospheric pollution from industrial emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. But the continuing acidification of soils and climate change need to be addressed.</li>
<li>Land is under threat from urbanisation, agricultural activities, and contamination from mines, industry and landfills.</li>
<li>The rate of soil regeneration in Europe is only about 5 cm in 500 years.</li>
<li>During the last twenty years built-up areas have expanded in Europe by 20%, in contrast to the population size which has only increased by 6%.</li>
<li>In 2000 Germanys increase in urban areas and infrastructure was 130 hectares a day.</li>
<li>Agriculture has considerable impact on the environment as regards land use. More land has been converted to cropland since 1945 than in the 18th and 19th centuries put together.</li>

<p>In January 2007, the European Commission proposed an <a class="external-link" href="http://ec.europa.eu/energy/energy_policy/documents_en.htm">integrated energy and climate change package</a> to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The energy package aimed at establishing a new Energy Policy for Europe to combat climate change and boost the EU’s energy security and competitiveness.</p>
<p>The package is based on <strong>three main pillars</strong>:</p>
<ul><li><strong>A true internal energy market.</strong> This aims to give energy users real choices and to trigger the huge investments needed in energy. Since 1 July 2007 all European citizens have been able to freely choose their electricity and gas supplier. The European Commission will have to ensure fair and dynamic competition in all Member States.</li><li><strong>Accelerating the shift to low carbon energy.</strong> This aims to maintain the EU’s position as a world leader in renewable energy, proposing that at least 20 % of the EU’s energy needs shall be met by renewable energy sources by 2020.</li><li><strong>Energy efficiency. </strong>This aims to save 20 % of primary energy consumption by 2020, reiterating a previous objective of the Commission. It also proposes increasing the use of fuel-efficient vehicles for transport; tougher standards and better labelling on appliances; improved energy performance of the EU’s existing buildings; and improved efficiency of heat and electricity generation, transmission and distribution.</li></ul>
<p>In March 2007, the European Council accepted most of these proposals and agreed on actions to develop <a class="external-link" href="http://europa.eu/european_council/conclusions/index_en.htm">a sustainable integrated European climate and energy policy</a>. The resulting policy pursues the following<strong> three objectives</strong>:</p>
<ul><li>Increasing security of supply;</li><li>Ensuring the competitiveness of European economies and the availability of affordable energy;</li><li>Promoting environmental sustainability and combating climate change.</li></ul>
<p>To meet these objectives, in March 2007 the European Council adopted a comprehensive energy Action Plan for the period 2007–2009, comprising priority actions in the following areas: an internal market for gas and electricity; security of supply; international energy policy; energy efficiency and renewable energies; and energy technologies.</p>
<p>In January 2008, the European Commission presented further <a class="external-link" href="http://ec.europa.eu/energy/climate_actions/index_en.htm">proposals to fight climate change and promote renewable energy</a>, including legally enforceable targets for Member States.</p>

					The EEA assesses long-term prospects for Europe's environment and the consequences of key-policy choices using various methodological approaches. The aims are to add value to current policy discussions, by consistently producing information with a broader and longer-term perspective, and to help organise the European environmental information systems to encompass information on future trends. The EEA also contributes knowledge and expertise to scenario-based assessments at pan-European and global levels, such as the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment or UNEP's GEO-4 scenarios.

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>EEA's scenarios activities contribute to the long-term perspective of the European 'state of the environment' report that is published every five years. In 2005, the <em><a class="external-link" href="http://reports.eea.europa.eu/state_of_environment_report_2005_1/en">European environment — State and outlook </a>report</em> and the complementary <a class="external-link" href="http://reports.eea.europa.eu/eea_report_2005_4/en"><em>European environment outlook</em> </a>report were published addressing a range of environmental concerns and their common driving forces in an integrated way and highlighting prospects for Europe's environment to the year 2030 and beyond. A similar exercise is due to be published in 2010.</p>
<p>Outlooks are also a component of regular assessment processes, e.g. greenhouse gas emissions and indicator-reporting processes of the EEA. Outlook studies and indicators are analysed on a regular basis. The <a class="external-link" href="http://scenarios.ew.eea.europa.eu/fol079729">review of quantitative models </a>is another frequent exercise.</p>
<p><a href="http://scenarios.ew.eea.europa.eu/reports/fol077184">PRELUDE </a>(PRospective Environmental analysis of Land Use Development in Europe) uses an innovative mix of illustration, text and state-of-the-art models to simulate five contrasting future environmental scenarios for a Europe affected by changing patterns of land use, climate change, agriculture and demographics. A new area for scenario-based assessments is the analysis of ecosystem services.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>EEA's scenarios activities contribute to the long-term perspective of the European 'state of the environment' report that is published every five years. In 2005, the <em><a class="external-link" href="http://reports.eea.europa.eu/state_of_environment_report_2005_1/en">European environment — State and outlook </a>report</em> and the complementary <a class="external-link" href="http://reports.eea.europa.eu/eea_report_2005_4/en"><em>European environment outlook</em> </a>report were published addressing a range of environmental concerns and their common driving forces in an integrated way and highlighting prospects for Europe's environment to the year 2030 and beyond. A similar exercise is due to be published in 2010.</p>
<p>Outlooks are also a component of regular assessment processes, e.g. greenhouse gas emissions and indicator-reporting processes of the EEA. Outlook studies and indicators are analysed on a regular basis. The <a class="external-link" href="http://scenarios.ew.eea.europa.eu/fol079729">review of quantitative models </a>is another frequent exercise.</p>
<p><a href="http://scenarios.ew.eea.europa.eu/reports/fol077184">PRELUDE </a>(PRospective Environmental analysis of Land Use Development in Europe) uses an innovative mix of illustration, text and state-of-the-art models to simulate five contrasting future environmental scenarios for a Europe affected by changing patterns of land use, climate change, agriculture and demographics. A new area for scenario-based assessments is the analysis of ecosystem services.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h2>Data</h2>
<p>Based on the <a href="http://dataservice.eea.europa.eu/atlas/available2.asp?type=findkeyword&amp;amp;theme=CLC2000">Corine land cover</a> data the EEA developed a set of analytical units — <a href="http://dataservice.eea.europa.eu/atlas/available.asp?type=search&amp;amp;search=UMZ">Urban Morphological Zones</a> (UMZ). The data show the extent of urban land-take in Europe, where sprawl happens and how it is shaped. Combined with other Corine land cover data on land-use changes, green areas and Natura 2000 sites, the influence of cities on natural and other land types can be analysed, as well as quality of life and population densities.</p>
<p>A tool is being developed to integrate EEA spatial data with other socio-economic and functional urban data like the <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page?_pageid=0,1136162,0_45572076&amp;amp;_dad=portal&amp;amp;_schema=PORTAL">Urban audit database</a> (Eurostat and DG REGIO) and <a href="http://www.espon.eu/">European Spatial Planning Observatory Network</a> (ESPON).</p>
<p>Following the Air Quality Framework Directive, EEA collects data on ambient air quality in European agglomerations (around 1&amp;nbsp;700 cities) in <a title="AirBase" class="internal-link" href="resolveuid/835a3117f304bad8ff6298c066abe636">AirBase</a>.</p>
<p>The Directive on Environmental Noise requires Member States to deliver noise exposure data in major agglomerations. The European Commission established a database of the reported information, supported by EEA reviews.</p>
<p>Urban wastewater treatment data are available in the Water Information System for Europe (<a href="../water/wise-viewer/">WISE</a>).</p>
<h2>Assessments</h2>
<p>The EEA Report <a href="http://reports.eea.europa.eu/eea_report_2006_10">Urban sprawl in Europe&amp;nbsp;— The ignored challenge</a> gives the first comprehensive overview of the urban sprawl problem, analysing impacts and drivers, such as transport and pricing policies. When socio-economic and functional data are further integrated, it will be possible to explore these relationships in more detail.</p>
<p>Urban assessments are also included in the EEA's regular air pollution assessments, its state and outlook reports, e.g. the <a href="http://reports.eea.europa.eu/state_of_environment_report_2005_1/en">State and outlook 2005</a> report, and other reports of a cross-cutting nature.</p>

					Why household consumption matters
				</target>

				<source>
					<p>The way we consume has both direct and indirect impacts on the environment in Europe and in other regions of the world. </p><p>Household consumption forms an important part of the production-consumption chain as it is consumers who make the final choice as to which goods and services to buy. Even though the environmental pressures caused by each household are relatively small compared to those caused by production activities, the millions of households in Europe combined are a major contributor to environmental problems such as climate change, air and water pollution, land use and waste generation. </p><p>For example, the use of energy in our homes and our dependence on cars is causing air pollution and increased emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) that lead to climate change. Also, we are creating more and more waste from household activities. But in addition to those and other direct effects, consumption also indirectly leads to environmental impacts from the production, processing and transportation of the goods we consume.</p><p>Despite the advances that have been made, for example in introducing more ecologically efficient production methods and reducing harmful emissions from vehicles, these have been offset by the rapidly rising consumption of goods and services. </p><p>And because much of what we consume comes from outside Europe, it is not only our own continents environment we are damaging. We have a global responsibility to find ways of building sustainability into our consumption patterns.</p>
<h2>Definition of sustainable consumption</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Sustainable consumption is the use of goods and services that respond to basic needs and bring a better quality of life, while minimising the use of natural resources, toxic materials and emissions of waste and pollutants over the life cycle, so as not to jeopardise the needs of future generations.</p>
<p class="source">Norwegian Ministry of Environment 1995 and 1995</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Understanding consumption patterns</h2>
<p>Mapping our patterns of consumption is not straightforward. They vary from country to country, and even from person to person, and are shaped by a range of interdependent social, cultural, political and economic trends in Europe and the rest of the world.</p><p>In the last ten years we have seen major developments that have changed how and what we consume. One is economic growth, globalisation and the opening of markets. As we become wealthier, we consume more. Although millions of Europeans are still living in poverty and are partly excluded from our consumption society, the average European now has a higher income and a higher standard of living than in the past, and has access to products from all over the world.</p><p>One recent development is that households are getting smaller on average, and partly because of that we use more energy and water and generate more waste per person. </p><p>Technological breakthroughs such as the internet and mobile phone have theoretically opened the way to shopping and working from home, though it has not yet been possible to observe accompanying reductions in demand for transport. </p><p>We have also changed culturally and socially. Individualisation, the belief in the individual and the desire for ownership and personal freedom, means that by consuming, we can express ourselves through the goods and services we choose and can enjoy the feeling of personal freedom through, for example, our cars and plane travel. </p><p>In fact, our passion for cars is now so strong that many people are prepared to put up with pollution and congested roads rather than use alternative forms of transport.</p>
<h2>How household consumption affects the environment</h2>
<p>The energy, materials and resources we use have direct and indirect impacts on the environment.</p><p>Generally speaking, the indirect environmental effects of consumption are higher than the direct ones. For example, when we prepare and eat food, the direct environmental effects of the cooking process are considerably less than the combined indirect effects of pollution and waste from the agricultural production, the industrial processing of the food and its transportation.</p><p>Many of the resources we need, such as fossil fuels and metals, are extracted in other parts of the world, and many goods consumed in Europe are now being produced in Asia, Latin America and Africa where labour is cheaper. </p><p>The emissions from the transport of those goods also takes place mainly outside Europe. The responsibility for these direct negative environmental effects from production activities in those regions therefore belongs to Europe. </p><p>In Europe itself many direct negative environmental effects of consumption such as air emissions from personal travel and waste from households are also increasing rapidly.</p>
<h2>The impact of food and drink consumption</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the 1960s an average European grocery had 2,000 product lines. A modern supermarket has more than 15,000.</p>
<p class="source">EEA SOER Report 2005</p>
</blockquote>
<p><p>Every stage of the food production chain - from growing crops, raising livestock or fish, to transportation and storage, manufacturing, distribution, purchasing, consumption, and dealing with waste - has environmental effects.</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Swedish researchers compared the greenhouse gas emissions given off over the life cycle of four different meals with the same energy and protein content, they found that they ranged from 190g carbon dioxide-equivalent for a vegetarian meal with local ingredients to 1,800g for a meal containing meat, with most ingredients imported.</p>
<p class="source">EEA SOER Report 2005</p>
</blockquote>
<p><p>Around a third of all the environmental impacts from households are related to food and drinks consumption. These include emissions to water, soil and air from livestock, agriculture and industry, overuse of fish resources and increased transport of food, but also waste from production processes.</p><p>At the other end of the chain, the shift to off-season fresh food, as well as to bottled water and convenience foods, has resulted in large streams of packaging waste.</p><p>More than two-thirds of packaging waste comes from food consumption.</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Households are one of the largest final energy consumers in the EU, accounting for 26.2% of total energy consumption in 2001, compared with 27.7% for industrial use.</p>
<p class="source">EEA SOER Report 2005</p>
</blockquote>
<p><p>The demand for new housing is eroding the available land, and we are using more energy in our homes than we used to. We are buying, and frequently replacing, many more electric and electronic goods such as computers, DVDs and kitchen appliances. As a result, even though the goods we buy are more energy-efficient than they used to be, we are continuing to produce the same amount of emissions of GHGs and rising amounts of waste. Total energy use has increased because we now have more appliances.</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>For washing machines, dishwashers and cold appliances like fridges and freezers, the average unit energy consumption fell by 21% between 1990 and 2002, but total energy consumption only fell by 2% as a result of increasing use of appliances.</p>
<p class="source">EEA SOER Report 2005</p>
</blockquote>
<p><p>The picture for water use is more positive. Consumption by households is on average less than 25% of total water use in Europe and has actually decreased in all regions of Europe in the past decade. This reduction can be directly linked to the water pricing and metering measures put in place to ensure the price of water better reflects its true costs.</p></p>
<h2>How we travel</h2>
<p>Higher disposable incomes, longer distances between home, work and school, more shopping and leisure activities, and deteriorating public transport which is becoming more and more expensive, are all factors in the shift towards the private car in recent decades. The number of households with two or more cars is on the rise, though approximately a quarter of EU households have none.</p><p>Europe has become a car-dominant society and growing energy consumption and emissions of GHGs from personal travel are increasingly contributing to climate change. The building of new roads has fragmented natural habitats and so affected biodiversity, and noise from traffic is also a problem across Europe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Between 1990 and 1998, 10 hectares were taken every day for motorway construction in the EU.</p>
<p class="source">EEA SOER Report 2005</p>
</blockquote>
<p><p>Technologies such as hybrid cars and fuels cells may help to reduce emissions but as long as consumption keeps growing, the net benefit may continue to be overwhelmed by growth in demand. </p><p>There are other prices to pay for our excessive car use. Congestion makes urban areas less and less accessible and leads to significant costs in terms of delivery delays and lost working hours, not to mention raised stress levels. </p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Around half of all passenger trips by car are less than 6 kilometres.</p>
<p class="source">EEA SOER Report 2005</p>
</blockquote>
<p><p>Another growing cause for concern is the escalation in plane trips. People are tending to visit more remote destinations and are taking more short breaks outside and inside Europe, partly as a result of the current low air fares. Aviation now almost matches rail transport in terms of total passenger kilometres travelled, and it is currently growing much faster than the economy. The environmental concern is mainly based on the high level of aircraft fuel emissions, which contribute to climate change.</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the period 2000 to 2030 the share of air travel in Europe is projected to increase from 5.5% to 10.5%, while public transports share will fall from 9% to 6.5%. This shift will bring about a corresponding increase in greenhouse gas emissions from passenger travel if no technological breakthroughs take place in the meantime.</p>
<p class="source">EEA SOER Report 2005</p>
</blockquote>
<p><p>On the plus side of personal travel, the numbers of walkers and cyclists is on the increase, and high-speed trains are gaining market share in some countries and becoming a viable alternative to the car and plane for intercity traffic. </p></p>
<h2>What can be done to bend the trend</h2>
<p>The first global political agreement on the need for sustainable consumption was made at the UN Conference on Environment and Development at Rio de Janeiro in 1992. In 2002 the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg agreed to develop a framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production, and there is commitment to strategies for sustainability at the EU and national levels.</p><p>Given the different types of consumer behaviour and influencing factors across Europe it is a complex challenge to design and implement suitable measures. Nevertheless public authorities at the global, EU, national, regional and local levels can influence the sustainability of consumption and production by providing a framework within which business and consumers can operate. The tools available include:</p>
<ul>
<li>legal and regulatory instruments (such as directives, laws and regulations)</li>
<li>market-based instruments (such as taxes and charges, tradable permits and subsidy removal)</li>
<li>enabling technological improvements</li>
<li>making information available.</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, the challenge is to implement the right combination of policy instruments that take different groups of consumers into account, in order to achieve the most sustainable results.</p><p>Business has an instrumental role in enabling and carrying out sustainable consumption and production. Operating within the framework provided by public authorities and meeting the demands of consumers, the challenge for business is to provide goods and services which are profitable and sustainable, when they are being both produced and consumed. </p><p>Europes consumers have arguably an important role to play since it is we who decide what goods and services to consume and in what amounts. </p><p>Provided that information on the environmental effects of the goods and services is available within the framework set by public authorities, and that prices are affordable, consumers can choose to buy goods and services that are sustainable through their life-cycle from production to consumption. </p><p>Other options for consumers include sustainable energy resources, modes of transport which have the least impact on the environment, reducing our use of water and generating less waste.</p>

Even though the environmental pressures caused by each household are relatively small compared to those caused by production activities, the millions of households in Europe combined are a major contributor to environmental problems such as climate change, air and water pollution, land use and waste generation. </p><p>For example, the use of energy in our homes and our dependence on cars is causing air pollution and increased emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) that lead to climate change. Also, we are creating more and more waste from household activities. But in addition to those and other direct effects, consumption also indirectly leads to environmental impacts from the production, processing and transportation of the goods we consume.</p><p>Despite the advances that have been made, for example in introducing more ecologically efficient production methods and reducing harmful emissions from vehicles, these have been offset by the rapidly rising consumption of goods and services. </p><p>And because much of what we consume comes from outside Europe, it is not only our own continents environment we are damaging. We have a global responsibility to find ways of building sustainability into our consumption patterns.</p>
<h2>Definition of sustainable consumption</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Sustainable consumption is the use of goods and services that respond to basic needs and bring a better quality of life, while minimising the use of natural resources, toxic materials and emissions of waste and pollutants over the life cycle, so as not to jeopardise the needs of future generations.</p>
<p class="source">Norwegian Ministry of Environment 1995 and 1995</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Understanding consumption patterns</h2>
<p>Mapping our patterns of consumption is not straightforward. They vary from country to country, and even from person to person, and are shaped by a range of interdependent social, cultural, political and economic trends in Europe and the rest of the world.</p><p>In the last ten years we have seen major developments that have changed how and what we consume. One is economic growth, globalisation and the opening of markets. As we become wealthier, we consume more. Although millions of Europeans are still living in poverty and are partly excluded from our consumption society, the average European now has a higher income and a higher standard of living than in the past, and has access to products from all over the world.</p><p>One recent development is that households are getting smaller on average, and partly because of that we use more energy and water and generate more waste per person. </p><p>Technological breakthroughs such as the internet and mobile phone have theoretically opened the way to shopping and working from home, though it has not yet been possible to observe accompanying reductions in demand for transport. </p><p>We have also changed culturally and socially. Individualisation, the belief in the individual and the desire for ownership and personal freedom, means that by consuming, we can express ourselves through the goods and services we choose and can enjoy the feeling of personal freedom through, for example, our cars and plane travel. </p><p>In fact, our passion for cars is now so strong that many people are prepared to put up with pollution and congested roads rather than use alternative forms of transport.</p>
<h2>How household consumption affects the environment</h2>
<p>The energy, materials and resources we use have direct and indirect impacts on the environment.</p><p>Generally speaking, the indirect environmental effects of consumption are higher than the direct ones. For example, when we prepare and eat food, the direct environmental effects of the cooking process are considerably less than the combined indirect effects of pollution and waste from the agricultural production, the industrial processing of the food and its transportation.</p><p>Many of the resources we need, such as fossil fuels and metals, are extracted in other parts of the world, and many goods consumed in Europe are now being produced in Asia, Latin America and Africa where labour is cheaper. </p><p>The emissions from the transport of those goods also takes place mainly outside Europe. The responsibility for these direct negative environmental effects from production activities in those regions therefore belongs to Europe. </p><p>In Europe itself many direct negative environmental effects of consumption such as air emissions from personal travel and waste from households are also increasing rapidly.</p>
<h2>The impact of food and drink consumption</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the 1960s an average European grocery had 2,000 product lines. A modern supermarket has more than 15,000.</p>
<p class="source">EEA SOER Report 2005</p>
</blockquote>
<p><p>Every stage of the food production chain - from growing crops, raising livestock or fish, to transportation and storage, manufacturing, distribution, purchasing, consumption, and dealing with waste - has environmental effects.</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Swedish researchers compared the greenhouse gas emissions given off over the life cycle of four different meals with the same energy and protein content, they found that they ranged from 190g carbon dioxide-equivalent for a vegetarian meal with local ingredients to 1,800g for a meal containing meat, with most ingredients imported.</p>
<p class="source">EEA SOER Report 2005</p>
</blockquote>
<p><p>Around a third of all the environmental impacts from households are related to food and drinks consumption. These include emissions to water, soil and air from livestock, agriculture and industry, overuse of fish resources and increased transport of food, but also waste from production processes.</p><p>At the other end of the chain, the shift to off-season fresh food, as well as to bottled water and convenience foods, has resulted in large streams of packaging waste.</p><p>More than two-thirds of packaging waste comes from food consumption.</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Households are one of the largest final energy consumers in the EU, accounting for 26.2% of total energy consumption in 2001, compared with 27.7% for industrial use.</p>
<p class="source">EEA SOER Report 2005</p>
</blockquote>
<p><p>The demand for new housing is eroding the available land, and we are using more energy in our homes than we used to. We are buying, and frequently replacing, many more electric and electronic goods such as computers, DVDs and kitchen appliances. As a result, even though the goods we buy are more energy-efficient than they used to be, we are continuing to produce the same amount of emissions of GHGs and rising amounts of waste. Total energy use has increased because we now have more appliances.</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>For washing machines, dishwashers and cold appliances like fridges and freezers, the average unit energy consumption fell by 21% between 1990 and 2002, but total energy consumption only fell by 2% as a result of increasing use of appliances.</p>
<p class="source">EEA SOER Report 2005</p>
</blockquote>
<p><p>The picture for water use is more positive. Consumption by households is on average less than 25% of total water use in Europe and has actually decreased in all regions of Europe in the past decade. This reduction can be directly linked to the water pricing and metering measures put in place to ensure the price of water better reflects its true costs.</p></p>
<h2>How we travel</h2>
<p>Higher disposable incomes, longer distances between home, work and school, more shopping and leisure activities, and deteriorating public transport which is becoming more and more expensive, are all factors in the shift towards the private car in recent decades. The number of households with two or more cars is on the rise, though approximately a quarter of EU households have none.</p><p>Europe has become a car-dominant society and growing energy consumption and emissions of GHGs from personal travel are increasingly contributing to climate change. The building of new roads has fragmented natural habitats and so affected biodiversity, and noise from traffic is also a problem across Europe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Between 1990 and 1998, 10 hectares were taken every day for motorway construction in the EU.</p>
<p class="source">EEA SOER Report 2005</p>
</blockquote>
<p><p>Technologies such as hybrid cars and fuels cells may help to reduce emissions but as long as consumption keeps growing, the net benefit may continue to be overwhelmed by growth in demand. </p><p>There are other prices to pay for our excessive car use. Congestion makes urban areas less and less accessible and leads to significant costs in terms of delivery delays and lost working hours, not to mention raised stress levels. </p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Around half of all passenger trips by car are less than 6 kilometres.</p>
<p class="source">EEA SOER Report 2005</p>
</blockquote>
<p><p>Another growing cause for concern is the escalation in plane trips. People are tending to visit more remote destinations and are taking more short breaks outside and inside Europe, partly as a result of the current low air fares. Aviation now almost matches rail transport in terms of total passenger kilometres travelled, and it is currently growing much faster than the economy. The environmental concern is mainly based on the high level of aircraft fuel emissions, which contribute to climate change.</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the period 2000 to 2030 the share of air travel in Europe is projected to increase from 5.5% to 10.5%, while public transports share will fall from 9% to 6.5%. This shift will bring about a corresponding increase in greenhouse gas emissions from passenger travel if no technological breakthroughs take place in the meantime.</p>
<p class="source">EEA SOER Report 2005</p>
</blockquote>
<p><p>On the plus side of personal travel, the numbers of walkers and cyclists is on the increase, and high-speed trains are gaining market share in some countries and becoming a viable alternative to the car and plane for intercity traffic. </p></p>
<h2>What can be done to bend the trend</h2>
<p>The first global political agreement on the need for sustainable consumption was made at the UN Conference on Environment and Development at Rio de Janeiro in 1992. In 2002 the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg agreed to develop a framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production, and there is commitment to strategies for sustainability at the EU and national levels.</p><p>Given the different types of consumer behaviour and influencing factors across Europe it is a complex challenge to design and implement suitable measures. Nevertheless public authorities at the global, EU, national, regional and local levels can influence the sustainability of consumption and production by providing a framework within which business and consumers can operate. The tools available include:</p>
<ul>
<li>legal and regulatory instruments (such as directives, laws and regulations)</li>
<li>market-based instruments (such as taxes and charges, tradable permits and subsidy removal)</li>
<li>enabling technological improvements</li>
<li>making information available.</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, the challenge is to implement the right combination of policy instruments that take different groups of consumers into account, in order to achieve the most sustainable results.</p><p>Business has an instrumental role in enabling and carrying out sustainable consumption and production. Operating within the framework provided by public authorities and meeting the demands of consumers, the challenge for business is to provide goods and services which are profitable and sustainable, when they are being both produced and consumed. </p><p>Europes consumers have arguably an important role to play since it is we who decide what goods and services to consume and in what amounts. </p><p>Provided that information on the environmental effects of the goods and services is available within the framework set by public authorities, and that prices are affordable, consumers can choose to buy goods and services that are sustainable through their life-cycle from production to consumption. </p><p>Other options for consumers include sustainable energy resources, modes of transport which have the least impact on the environment, reducing our use of water and generating less waste.</p>

					<h2>The concerns</h2>
<p>The increase in asthma, the fall in sperm counts, the declining numbers of fish and bird species - these are only some of the public concerns that suggest there is a link between environmental quality and our health. </p><p>We now have evidence that air pollution and certain hazardous chemicals in air, food and water are contributors to environment-related diseases in particular circumstances. These include some types of cancer, respiratory diseases, allergies and asthma, cardiovascular disease, and neurological, reproductive and developmental disorders.  </p><p>Climate change is bringing with it clear risks to Europeans safety, with the increasing prevalence of flash floods, severe forest fires and heat waves, and certain hot climate diseases. </p><p>And there are other unknown environment-related health threats to add to the list, such as the impact of electromagnetic and radio-frequency fields, and ecological imbalances that cause toxic algae to spread.</p>
<h2>Who is at risk</h2>
<p>In disease studies, people who live in industrialised countries tend to be affected differently to people in developing countries, and there are differences between the east and west of Europe. In some Eastern European countries for example environment-related diseases tend to be mainly related to limited access to proper food, housing, health care and safe drinking water. In Western Europe on the other hand they are more to do with air pollution in urban areas and with chemicals in water and food.</p><p>Other factors that influence a persons risk of developing one of these diseases or disorders are their genes, their age, what they eat and drink, and socio-economic factors such as their level of income and education. </p><p>Children are especially vulnerable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On average, 7% of European children aged 4-10 have problems with asthma, which is partly linked to environmental factors, and among children aged 0-4 years, 1.8-6.4% of deaths from all causes were attributable to outdoor air pollution. There has also been a small but significant increase in childhood cancers since the mid 1980s.</p>
<p class="source">EEA SOER Report 2005</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Air quality and respiratory problems</h2>
<p>Air pollution is the environmental factor with the greatest impact on health in Europe and there are many studies that show that respiratory health and quality of life both improve when air quality improves.  </p><p>The air pollutants that affect the respiratory system are ozone, nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, and particulate matter. </p><p>The breathing in of fine particulate matter (released into the air by the burning of fossil fuels, among other sources) significantly increases the numbers of deaths from cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary diseases. Exposure to particulate matter is also linked to increased frequency of chronic bronchitis, respiratory hospital admissions and restricted activity days.</p><p>Ground level ozone, one of the components of smog and produced through vehicle exhaust and industrial emissions, also has severe implications for respiratory health.</p>
<h2>Smog kills 2000 people in London</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In December 1952 dense smog - a mixture of fog and coal smoke - descended on London. Records from Londons hospitals showed that more than 2 000 people died from the exposure to air pollutants during one week, and there was strong pressure for this never to happen again. Another smog incident that occurred in 1962 with about 800 deaths further demonstrated the need for action.</p>
<p class="source">Late lessons from early warnings</p>
</blockquote>
<p><p>Although levels of particulate matter and ozone have both been reduced considerably since then, recent estimates indicate that 20 million Europeans suffer from respiratory problems. The European Commission Clean Air for Europe (CAFE) programme found that in 2000 around 350,000 people were dying prematurely due to outdoor pollution of fine particulate matter alone. This corresponds to an average loss of life expectancy of about 9 months for every EU citizen.</p></p>

<p>Research shows that children who grow up in areas with atmospheric pollution are twice as likely to develop reduced lung function when they grow up as children from rural areas, which is why more and more scientists and health-care professionals are now studying foetal life and early childhood. </p><p>Asthma is on the increase all over Europe and a large portion of this increase is in asthma in children. Asthmatics are particularly sensitive to air quality and several studies have shown a strong link between exposure to air pollution and the aggravation of asthma.  </p><p>However, it seems that children do not initially become asthmatic because of air pollution, as can be shown by the fact that allergic disorders including asthma are relatively less common in Eastern Europe, despite levels of many air pollutants being higher there than in Western Europe. It is thought that asthma has many triggers including nutritional and genetic factors.</p>

<p>Until now, most research into air quality has concentrated on levels of pollution found outdoors. Yet European children spend 90% of their time indoors, and poor indoor air quality can cause a number of health problems including cancer, allergies, sleeping and concentration problems, and coughing, wheezing and asthma-like symptoms in children. </p><p>Indoor pollution comes from building materials, paints, furniture and carpets, the chemicals in cleaning agents, disinfectants and air cleaners, as well as open fires. Humidity indoors stimulates the development of biological pollutants such as mites, mould and bacteria, and increases the release of chemicals from building materials. Research has found respiratory problems including asthma in children from homes with visible damp and mould, and also where there is a combination of moisture, mould, tobacco smoke, gas stoves, and mites and allergens from pets.</p>

<h2>Radiation and cancer</h2>
<p>There are well-known cancer risks from the accidental release of radiation from nuclear power stations, but in fact around 80% of radiation comes from natural sources and has the same potentially damaging effects on our health as man-made radiation. </p><p>Uranium is a chemical element which is found naturally in soil, rocks and water. When it decays it forms radon, a radioactive gas, which seeps into buildings through the ground. Radon is easily absorbed into dust particles and when inhaled causes gene damage and mutations which can lead to lung cancer. There are studies suggesting that radon could also increase the risk of childhood leukaemia but there is no definite evidence of this.</p><p>Another type of radiation, ultra-violet (UV) radiation from the sun, has been shown to damage health. Approximately 80-90% of all skin cancers can be related to UV radiation.</p>

<h2>Risks from chemicals in the environment</h2>
<p>Chemical pollution comes from industry, agriculture, waste disposal and incineration and products used in the home. </p><p>Certain chemicals have detrimental effects on childrens neurodevelopment (their behaviour, memory or ability to learn):</p>
<ul>
<li>Mercury, which can be present in fish, is well known to result in attention problems, reduced learning ability and slightly reduced IQ in children.</li>
<li>Lead has been proven to affect neurodevelopment. The ban on leaded petrol has been very successful in lowering blood lead levels in children, but more data are currently being collected.</li>
<li>Prenatal exposure to PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls, which are present in some pesticides, paints and plastics, among other substances) have been shown to have a negative effect on the childs cognitive processes, motor development and reflexes, and to interfere with the function of the thyroid hormone, which is crucial for normal neurodevelopment.</li>
</ul>

<p>A number of chemicals are suspected carcinogens, including PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), which are given off when wood, coal, and diesel are burned.</p><p>Industrial chemicals and pesticides could be a factor behind the increase in endocrine disruption, in which the hormone-dependent functions in the body (embryonic development, sperm production, control of the menstrual cycle, the onset of puberty, among others) are affected. </p><p>Worldwide, semen quality has declined over the past 50 years. Although there is no clear link with chemicals in humans, there is a wealth of data showing that industrial chemicals, pesticides and natural hormone-like substances found in different types of food are interfering with the endocrine systems of birds, fish and amphibians.</p>

<h2>Climate change and health</h2>
<p>The summer heat waves of 2003 resulted in more than 20,000 excess deaths in Europe, and we are likely to see more frequent, intense summer heat in the years to come. Increasingly heavy rainfall is making flash floods more common, with the obvious risk to life, but there are also health-related side effects of living in flood-prone areas such as stress and depression. At the other extreme, droughts will decrease the water supply and so increase the possibility of water and food-borne diseases.</p><p>Rising temperatures mean that insects and parasites are spreading geographically. Tick-borne diseases are reaching epidemic proportions in many parts of Europe, and localised outbreaks of malaria are expected in areas where the disease has been eradicated but the malaria-carrying mosquitoes (the Anopheles species) are still present.</p>

<h2>The challenge to science</h2>
<p>Mounting public concern about the safety of the environment has put scientists under pressure to find out more about how environmental quality affects human health, so that preventive and protective strategies can be put in place.</p><p>Unfortunately, however, there is still a lack of detailed information about the interaction between the environment and human health. Because exposure to pollution, chemicals and other contaminants takes place over a whole life-cycle, from the moment of conception through childhood and maturity to old age, data obviously takes a long time to collect. The picture of what is happening to a test subject is also muddied by the reality that there is usually a combination of environmental stressors from different sources. When you add individuals different genetic make-up, age, diet, income and education level to the equation, it can be seen that the situation is extremely complex.</p><p>Much of our knowledge is based on experiments in which animals are exposed to lethal levels of chemicals which have acute effects and the information is fed into risk assessment models. But this approach is not capable of reproducing the subtle interactions between the environment and human health. In a formidable challenge for researchers, a new model is being developed that will use toxicology and risk assessment to analyse and assess the interactions realistically.  This must be a priority for further research. </p><p>Studying animals in the wild is another way of understanding how environmental exposures affect health, as many fundamental physiological processes are similar in animals and humans.  The effects on wildlife of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), which come from pesticides and industrial processes, are a good example of this. Marine predators like seals, whales, dolphins and polar bears have been shown to have high levels of POP residues in their bodies, obtained through the food chain, and a number of physiological effects have been observed in them, including infertility, immunodeficiency and different types of tissue malformation.</p>

<h2>What is being done to address the problem</h2>
<p>Although there is limited data confirming definite links between environmental issues and human health, precautionary measures should still be taken, given the uncertainties.</p><p>Concern for human health is behind policies that target air, water, soil quality and chemicals, and the EU Environment and Health Action Plan 2004-2010 has identified four top priority groups of diseases and disorders: </p>
<ul>
<li>childhood respiratory disease and asthma</li>
<li>childhood cancer</li>
<li>neurodevelopmental disorders, and</li>
<li>endocrine disruption.</li>
</ul>
<p>The European Commissions ambition is to create an integrated environment and health information system, and Children Environment and Health is currently a priority issue on several international agendas. A new proactive and participatory framework for risk analysis and hazard control must be developed which will encompass scientific assessment of risks, uncertainties and ignorance, options for action, communication, and evaluations of actions taken.</p><p>But prevention is not only a matter of policy and legislation. Individuals can make a number of lifestyle and behavioural changes to help prevent health problems - eating a balanced diet, taking exercise, and reducing vehicle emissions by cutting down on their use of cars and plane travel, for example.</p>

<p>Until now, most research into air quality has concentrated on levels of pollution found outdoors. Yet European children spend 90% of their time indoors, and poor indoor air quality can cause a number of health problems including cancer, allergies, sleeping and concentration problems, and coughing, wheezing and asthma-like symptoms in children. </p><p>Indoor pollution comes from building materials, paints, furniture and carpets, the chemicals in cleaning agents, disinfectants and air cleaners, as well as open fires. Humidity indoors stimulates the development of biological pollutants such as mites, mould and bacteria, and increases the release of chemicals from building materials. Research has found respiratory problems including asthma in children from homes with visible damp and mould, and also where there is a combination of moisture, mould, tobacco smoke, gas stoves, and mites and allergens from pets.</p>

<h2>Radiation and cancer</h2>
<p>There are well-known cancer risks from the accidental release of radiation from nuclear power stations, but in fact around 80% of radiation comes from natural sources and has the same potentially damaging effects on our health as man-made radiation. </p><p>Uranium is a chemical element which is found naturally in soil, rocks and water. When it decays it forms radon, a radioactive gas, which seeps into buildings through the ground. Radon is easily absorbed into dust particles and when inhaled causes gene damage and mutations which can lead to lung cancer. There are studies suggesting that radon could also increase the risk of childhood leukaemia but there is no definite evidence of this.</p><p>Another type of radiation, ultra-violet (UV) radiation from the sun, has been shown to damage health. Approximately 80-90% of all skin cancers can be related to UV radiation.</p>

<h2>Risks from chemicals in the environment</h2>
<p>Chemical pollution comes from industry, agriculture, waste disposal and incineration and products used in the home. </p><p>Certain chemicals have detrimental effects on childrens neurodevelopment (their behaviour, memory or ability to learn):</p>
<ul>
<li>Mercury, which can be present in fish, is well known to result in attention problems, reduced learning ability and slightly reduced IQ in children.</li>
<li>Lead has been proven to affect neurodevelopment. The ban on leaded petrol has been very successful in lowering blood lead levels in children, but more data are currently being collected.</li>
<li>Prenatal exposure to PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls, which are present in some pesticides, paints and plastics, among other substances) have been shown to have a negative effect on the childs cognitive processes, motor development and reflexes, and to interfere with the function of the thyroid hormone, which is crucial for normal neurodevelopment.</li>
</ul>

<p>A number of chemicals are suspected carcinogens, including PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), which are given off when wood, coal, and diesel are burned.</p><p>Industrial chemicals and pesticides could be a factor behind the increase in endocrine disruption, in which the hormone-dependent functions in the body (embryonic development, sperm production, control of the menstrual cycle, the onset of puberty, among others) are affected. </p><p>Worldwide, semen quality has declined over the past 50 years. Although there is no clear link with chemicals in humans, there is a wealth of data showing that industrial chemicals, pesticides and natural hormone-like substances found in different types of food are interfering with the endocrine systems of birds, fish and amphibians.</p>

<h2>Climate change and health</h2>
<p>The summer heat waves of 2003 resulted in more than 20,000 excess deaths in Europe, and we are likely to see more frequent, intense summer heat in the years to come. Increasingly heavy rainfall is making flash floods more common, with the obvious risk to life, but there are also health-related side effects of living in flood-prone areas such as stress and depression. At the other extreme, droughts will decrease the water supply and so increase the possibility of water and food-borne diseases.</p><p>Rising temperatures mean that insects and parasites are spreading geographically. Tick-borne diseases are reaching epidemic proportions in many parts of Europe, and localised outbreaks of malaria are expected in areas where the disease has been eradicated but the malaria-carrying mosquitoes (the Anopheles species) are still present.</p>

<h2>The challenge to science</h2>
<p>Mounting public concern about the safety of the environment has put scientists under pressure to find out more about how environmental quality affects human health, so that preventive and protective strategies can be put in place.</p><p>Unfortunately, however, there is still a lack of detailed information about the interaction between the environment and human health. Because exposure to pollution, chemicals and other contaminants takes place over a whole life-cycle, from the moment of conception through childhood and maturity to old age, data obviously takes a long time to collect. The picture of what is happening to a test subject is also muddied by the reality that there is usually a combination of environmental stressors from different sources. When you add individuals different genetic make-up, age, diet, income and education level to the equation, it can be seen that the situation is extremely complex.</p><p>Much of our knowledge is based on experiments in which animals are exposed to lethal levels of chemicals which have acute effects and the information is fed into risk assessment models. But this approach is not capable of reproducing the subtle interactions between the environment and human health. In a formidable challenge for researchers, a new model is being developed that will use toxicology and risk assessment to analyse and assess the interactions realistically.  This must be a priority for further research. </p><p>Studying animals in the wild is another way of understanding how environmental exposures affect health, as many fundamental physiological processes are similar in animals and humans.  The effects on wildlife of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), which come from pesticides and industrial processes, are a good example of this. Marine predators like seals, whales, dolphins and polar bears have been shown to have high levels of POP residues in their bodies, obtained through the food chain, and a number of physiological effects have been observed in them, including infertility, immunodeficiency and different types of tissue malformation.</p>

<h2>What is being done to address the problem</h2>
<p>Although there is limited data confirming definite links between environmental issues and human health, precautionary measures should still be taken, given the uncertainties.</p><p>Concern for human health is behind policies that target air, water, soil quality and chemicals, and the EU Environment and Health Action Plan 2004-2010 has identified four top priority groups of diseases and disorders: </p>
<ul>
<li>childhood respiratory disease and asthma</li>
<li>childhood cancer</li>
<li>neurodevelopmental disorders, and</li>
<li>endocrine disruption.</li>
</ul>
<p>The European Commissions ambition is to create an integrated environment and health information system, and Children Environment and Health is currently a priority issue on several international agendas. A new proactive and participatory framework for risk analysis and hazard control must be developed which will encompass scientific assessment of risks, uncertainties and ignorance, options for action, communication, and evaluations of actions taken.</p><p>But prevention is not only a matter of policy and legislation. Individuals can make a number of lifestyle and behavioural changes to help prevent health problems - eating a balanced diet, taking exercise, and reducing vehicle emissions by cutting down on their use of cars and plane travel, for example.</p>

					<h2>Resource consumption in perspective</h2>
<p>Our economies are based on the use and consumption of natural resources. And it is not just industry - we all consume resources in our homes, through personal travel and our food and drink.</p><p>The most environmentally significant resources are materials, energy and land. Some resources, such as forests and fish, are renewable. Others, such as oil and land, are not, and will eventually run out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Current materials consumption in industrialised countries is between 31 and 74 tonnes per person per year.</p>
<p class="source">EEA SOER report 2005</p>
</blockquote>
<p><p>Over the next fifty years the total consumption of natural resources by the world population is projected to be between double and five times what it is now.  This continued rise in resource use is likely to have a range of negative effects including materials shortages, ecological crises and possibly even conflict between countries over access to resources.</p><p>It is clear that we face an urgent challenge to our production and consumption patterns if we are to manage our resources sustainably and to provide future generations with the materials they need. It is an issue which has been widely debated since the Rio de Janeiro summit in 1992, with many policies put in place since then, such as the 2001 EU Sustainable Development Strategy.</p></p>
<h2>Achieving growth while minimising environmental effects</h2>
<p>The ideal we are aiming for is to separate economic growth from damage to the environment. This de-linking is known in environmental policy as decoupling. </p><p>Relative decoupling occurs when an environmental problem grows, but more slowly than the underlying economic driver in the same period. Absolute decoupling is when an environmental problem actually decreases while the economy grows.</p><p>Over the past decade, there has been a relative decoupling of economic growth from material and energy consumption in many EU countries, i.e.  the increase in resource consumption (materials and energy) is no longer in proportion to the rate of economic growth. However, even though Europeans tend to use resources more efficiently, we do not use fewer resources in absolute terms. </p>
<h2>What drives our material and energy use</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The global population is expected to grow by 50% over the next 50 years.</p>
<p class="source">EEA SOER report 2005</p>
</blockquote>
<p><p>There are three basic factors which determine how quickly we use up our resources.</p><p>First, population size. This is not a significant factor in most European countries, as it is currently static and may even decline in the next 50 years. Nevertheless, the population in the worlds developing countries is rising sharply and this is bound to have an impact on EU use of resources which are consumed or traded globally, such as oil, fish and tropical timber.</p><p>Secondly, the extent to which we cover our needs. We have to exchange raw materials in order to produce goods and services which can then be sold on the world market. </p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the 2nd half of the 20th century, global trade volumes grew between 6 to 8 times in size for raw materials, and as much as 40 times for manufactured goods.</p>
<p class="source">EEA SOER report 2005</p>
</blockquote>
<p><p>The third factor is the patterns of production and consumption, which include the types of technology used and how efficient they are.  For instance, introducing fossil energy-based technologies to replace human and animal labour significantly improved production efficiency and increased wealth, but the result was a dramatic increase in the use of natural resources.</p><p>Industrialised countries have made significant improvements to their energy and resource efficiency, but some of the gain has been offset by more widespread consumption.</p><p>Another pattern of production/consumption is a countrys economic system. Manufacturing and service-oriented economies tend to be fairly stable in their use of basic resources compared with economies based mainly on the extraction and processing of basic natural resources. Most EU Member States have entered the stage of post-industrial growth and have moved towards a service-oriented and knowledge-based economy, so our main driving forces are economic growth and the pattern of development.</p><p>Although our economic systems indicate that in general the EUs consumption of resources is not rising as fast as it is elsewhere, the increasing population size and economic growth in developing countries mean that dramatic technological breakthroughs or changes in the patterns of consumption will be needed to achieve a sustainable global balance.</p></p>
<h2>The environment as a resource</h2>
<p>The Earth is a closed material system, and it is already generally accepted that there are physical limits to continuing economic growth based on increasing resource use. For some non-renewable resources such as fossil fuels and land, availability is already a problem. Fossil fuels will run out, and land is disappearing fast due to increasing urbanisation. </p><p>For many renewable resources such as fish stocks, forests and water, the main challenge is to enable them to regenerate sustainably.</p><p>Another issue is whether the environment itself can cope with the impacts of resource use. The natural world can only go so far in acting as a sink to absorb discharges and emissions without being seriously affected. For example, we are currently seeing signs that a possibly irreversible climate change is taking place as a result of emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.</p>
<h2>Renewable resources</h2>
<p>Renewable resources are ones that can regenerate in a relatively short time. If their use is to be sustainable, their consumption or extraction rate needs to be maintained within the reproductive capacity of the natural system in question.</p>
<h2><i>Water</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Annual average run-off from rainfall varies from more than 3,000 mm in western Norway to less than 25 mm in southern and central Spain.</p>
<p class="source">EEA SOER report 2005</p>
</blockquote>
<p><p>In general, Europe does not suffer from the devastating water shortages and poor water quality experienced by some other parts of the world, although several countries have been experiencing local water shortages. Yet water is under threat in many parts of Europe because of rising population in urban areas, economic growth, intensive agriculture, growing tourism and leisure activities, and from the lack of proper supply and treatment facilities. It is a problem both of quantity and quality. </p><p>Chemicals and waste have historically been the main pollutants of water, but over the past twenty years considerable progress has been made in reducing industrial and urban discharges, and contamination of drinking and bathing water is now largely under control.</p><p>There has been far less success in controlling discharges from agriculture, however, and high concentrations of pesticides and heavy metals can still be found in many European waters.</p></p>
<h2><i>Fish</i></h2>
<p>The seas around Europe provide about 10% of the worlds fish catches, but many of our stocks are now considered to be in a critical state. Despite policies to reduce catches, most fish stocks in European waters are over-fished or fully exploited, threatening fish populations and provoking conflicts between EU Member States. </p><p>Cod is a good example of a marine fish resource under pressure. Over-fishing in the North Sea for decades has resulted in a small and young spawning stock, and yet the optimal catch age is 6-7 years when the fish weigh around 8 kilos. If spawning stocks were allowed to grow, the annual value of the yield could double from around EUR 200 to 400 million.</p><p>There are obvious long-term gains from the sustainable use and management of fish. Larger yields can be created, local fishing communities can continue to develop, and there is less risk of long-term adverse effects on marine ecosystems.</p>

<h2><i>Forests</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The term sustainable was first used in 1713 by Hans Carl von Carlowitz to refer to the ability to replace what is cut down from a forest.</p>
<p class="source"></p>
</blockquote>
<p><p>Forests provide benefits to our ecology and our economy.  Forest area accounts for around a third of Europes territory, and is increasing on average by about half a million hectares a year. Tree conditions and soil quality have improved to a certain extent because of the decrease in atmospheric pollution from industrial emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. There has been a steady increase in the consumption of all forest products. </p><p>The continuing acidification of soils and climate change are the issues that need to be dealt with if there is to be sustainable management of our expanding forests. </p></p>
<h2>Non-renewable resources</h2>
<p>Non-renewable resources are ones whose natural regeneration cycle is extremely long. For example, fossil fuels and soils do regenerate but this takes thousands of years. </p><p>The use of resources needs be managed in such a way that future generations should have enough for their needs and be able to live in a world that is not environmentally degraded as a result of our over-consumption.</p><p>There are various ways of reducing the use and impacts and consumption of non-renewable resources. One option is to use them more efficiently, as with more fuel-efficient cars. Another possibility is to extend their life-cycle by maintenance, reuse and recycling.</p><p>For some resources such as fossil fuels and land, scarcity is a real threat. </p>
<h2><i>Fossil fuels</i></h2>
<p>Most of the energy we use in Europe comes from fossil fuels. Each year almost 4 tonnes are consumed per capita in the 15 original member countries of the EU and about half that is imported. Energy consumption is increasing, mainly because of growth in transport but also in the household and service sectors. On a more positive note, fossil fuel-related emissions of air pollutants have come down over the last ten years, thanks to the use of end-of-pipe cleaning equipment such as catalytic convertors. </p><p>Whether we will have enough fossil fuels for our needs in the years to come is a matter of debate. Global reserves are finite and the question is not whether but when the reserves will be exhausted. Some estimates show that the mid-depletion point of worldwide crude oil reserves could be reached within the next 10-20 years. </p>
<h2><i>Land</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>About 47% of European land is used for agriculture, 36% for forestry, and 17% for all other uses, including cities, towns and infrastructure.</p>
<p class="source">EEA SOER report 2005</p>
</blockquote>
<p><p>Although land cannot be consumed as such, it is under threat from human activities through:</p></p>
<ul>
<li>Sealing (isolation of the soil from the atmosphere by a covering such as asphalt pavements)</li>
<li>Deforestation or agricultural activities which leach nutrients or erode the soil</li>
<li>Contamination from mines, industry and landfills, among other sources.</li>
</ul>
<p>It can take centuries for soil to recover naturally from all these activities - the rate of soil generation in Europe can be as low as 5 cm in 500 years. </p><p>All major European cities and urban areas have high proportions of sealed land. During the last twenty years built-up areas have expanded in Europe by 20%, in contrast to the population size which has only increased by 6%.</p><p>Road building, as well as leading to the negative effects of sealing, is the main contributor to the increasing fragmentation of the landscape.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2000 Germanys increase in urban areas and infrastructure was about 50,000 hectares, with a total area equivalent to eighty football pitches being sealed every day.</p>
<p class="source">EEA SOER Report 2005</p>
</blockquote>
<p><p>Agricultures continuing search for efficiency, lower costs and increased scale of production is putting substantial pressure on the environment, landscapes and biodiversity. An example of its impact is the fact that more land has been converted to cropland since 1945 than in the 18th and 19th centuries put together. </p></p>
<h2>Keeping the situation under control</h2>
<p>The use and management of natural resources are directly or indirectly addressed in almost all the EU policies (the Common Agricultural Policy, the Common Fisheries Policies, regional development policy, and transport and energy policies) whether environmentally-oriented or not.  </p><p>On the whole, these policies have resulted in better management of impacts on the environment, but there are considerable differences between countries, and many have great potential for improvement.</p><p>Europe needs to prepare for the effects of a global increase in resource consumption. It is unlikely that simply by making technological improvements we can significantly reduce our use of resources and we may have to adopt a radically different approach towards the sustainability of our current lifestyles and patterns of consumption.</p>

<p>Non-renewable resources are ones whose natural regeneration cycle is extremely long. For example, fossil fuels and soils do regenerate but this takes thousands of years. </p><p>The use of resources needs be managed in such a way that future generations should have enough for their needs and be able to live in a world that is not environmentally degraded as a result of our over-consumption.</p><p>There are various ways of reducing the use and impacts and consumption of non-renewable resources. One option is to use them more efficiently, as with more fuel-efficient cars. Another possibility is to extend their life-cycle by maintenance, reuse and recycling.</p><p>For some resources such as fossil fuels and land, scarcity is a real threat. </p>
<h2><i>Fossil fuels</i></h2>
<p>Most of the energy we use in Europe comes from fossil fuels. Each year almost 4 tonnes are consumed per capita in the 15 original member countries of the EU and about half that is imported. Energy consumption is increasing, mainly because of growth in transport but also in the household and service sectors. On a more positive note, fossil fuel-related emissions of air pollutants have come down over the last ten years, thanks to the use of end-of-pipe cleaning equipment such as catalytic convertors. </p><p>Whether we will have enough fossil fuels for our needs in the years to come is a matter of debate. Global reserves are finite and the question is not whether but when the reserves will be exhausted. Some estimates show that the mid-depletion point of worldwide crude oil reserves could be reached within the next 10-20 years. </p>
<h2><i>Land</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>About 47% of European land is used for agriculture, 36% for forestry, and 17% for all other uses, including cities, towns and infrastructure.</p>
<p class="source">EEA SOER report 2005</p>
</blockquote>
<p><p>Although land cannot be consumed as such, it is under threat from human activities through:</p></p>
<ul>
<li>Sealing (isolation of the soil from the atmosphere by a covering such as asphalt pavements)</li>
<li>Deforestation or agricultural activities which leach nutrients or erode the soil</li>
<li>Contamination from mines, industry and landfills, among other sources.</li>
</ul>
<p>It can take centuries for soil to recover naturally from all these activities - the rate of soil generation in Europe can be as low as 5 cm in 500 years. </p><p>All major European cities and urban areas have high proportions of sealed land. During the last twenty years built-up areas have expanded in Europe by 20%, in contrast to the population size which has only increased by 6%.</p><p>Road building, as well as leading to the negative effects of sealing, is the main contributor to the increasing fragmentation of the landscape.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2000 Germanys increase in urban areas and infrastructure was about 50,000 hectares, with a total area equivalent to eighty football pitches being sealed every day.</p>
<p class="source">EEA SOER Report 2005</p>
</blockquote>
<p><p>Agricultures continuing search for efficiency, lower costs and increased scale of production is putting substantial pressure on the environment, landscapes and biodiversity. An example of its impact is the fact that more land has been converted to cropland since 1945 than in the 18th and 19th centuries put together. </p></p>
<h2>Keeping the situation under control</h2>
<p>The use and management of natural resources are directly or indirectly addressed in almost all the EU policies (the Common Agricultural Policy, the Common Fisheries Policies, regional development policy, and transport and energy policies) whether environmentally-oriented or not.  </p><p>On the whole, these policies have resulted in better management of impacts on the environment, but there are considerable differences between countries, and many have great potential for improvement.</p><p>Europe needs to prepare for the effects of a global increase in resource consumption. It is unlikely that simply by making technological improvements we can significantly reduce our use of resources and we may have to adopt a radically different approach towards the sustainability of our current lifestyles and patterns of consumption.</p>

					Understanding household consumption patterns is about understanding human behaviour. Consumption patterns in Europe are very different to those 50 years ago. Important factors that drive our consumption include growing incomes, globalisation of the economy, technological breakthroughs (such as the Internet and mobile phones), decreasing household sizes and an ageing population. At the same time, the growing number of goods and services we consume often offsets the efficiency gains we achieved through for example, improved production technologies and processes. As a result, environmental pressures are increasing. Housing, food and drink, and mobility have the greatest environmental impact over their lifecycle in terms of emissions of greenhouse gases, acidifying and ozone-depleting substances as well as resource use.

<p><a title="Tourism introduction" class="internal-link" href="resolveuid/8a3ca41536dfa40f6742ec2776512ff7">Tourism</a>&amp;nbsp;is one of the fastest growing sectors. Travel to and from the destination is most often done by car or plane. In tourist destinations, the consumption of water and energy, the use of land and the generation of waste and wastewater are all increasing.</p>

					Sustainable household consumption is not yet backed by well-defined policy objectives and measures. Changing people's behaviour is difficult and often politically sensitive. Some policy instruments, such as eco-labelling, environmental taxes or subsidies, raising awareness, and product standards, are already used to change consumption patterns in a more sustainable direction. Increasingly, the focus is on the sustainable consumption and production policies. This is a common challenge where all players, including public authorities, business and consumers, come together to take responsibility and implement actions. Solutions are being looked for at the global level: in Europe and other world regions, as well as nationally and locally.

<p>The role of public authorities is to provide the framework within which business and consumers can operate&amp;nbsp;— using legal, market-based information and other tools. Businesses face the challenge of producing goods and services that are sustainable over their entire life-cycle. The challenge for consumers is to choose sustainable goods and services&amp;nbsp;— as far as these are known, available or affordable.</p>
<h2>Global policies</h2>
<p>Sustainable consumption makes part of the <a class="external-link" href="http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/documents/agenda21/index.htm">Agenda 21</a>, which was adopted at the Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. At the 2002 <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/documents/WSSD_POI_PD/English/POIToc.htm">World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg</a>, an agreement was reached to develop a framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production (SCP) and in 2003, the global 'Marrakech Process' was started to develop this framework. In 2010 and 2011, the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development will review this global process to achieve more sustainable consumption and production.</p>
<h2>European Union</h2>
<p>In order to raise awareness, as well as to influence consumer behaviour and improve the environmental performance of products and services, there are several policy instruments in current use. &amp;nbsp;Examples include the eco-labelling of food products, such as organic foods, and the energy-efficiency labelling of household appliances. Energy consumption is also tackled by other EU policies, e.g. the EU Action Plan for Energy Efficiency, the strategy to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from new cars and vans, and the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive.</p>
<p>Sustainable consumption and production is now one of the seven key challenges of the renewed <a class="external-link" href="http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/06/st10/st10117.en06.pdf">EU Sustainable Development Strategy</a>. The European Commission is expected to issue a Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) Action plan in 2008.</p>
<h2>National, regional and local policies</h2>
<p>A number of EEA member countries have adopted sustainable consumption and production action plans of their own or address those issues as part of their sustainable development strategies. Other countries are dealing with these challenges using other names or headings. Sometimes consumption issues are tackled via sectoral policies such as environment, transport, energy or agricultural policies. Many initiatives and actions are also taken at the regional and local level, for example within regional sustainable development strategies and the Agenda 21 processes.</p>

<p>We now use transport far more than we did twenty or thirty years ago. We travel further to get to our places of work and the shops, we make many more plane trips, and we consume goods and produce that have been carried from the other side of the world. </p><p>Our habits and patterns of consumption have been formed over many years and are the result of the opening up of international markets, rapid economic growth, and town planning which did not have minimisation of transport as a priority.  </p><p>Yet these transport habits come at a price: harm to our health and the environment.  </p><p>Although the emissions from vehicle exhausts have decreased because we now have cleaner fuel and more efficient engines, the air in our cities is still polluted because motorised vehicles are being used much more often, and over longer distances, than they were in the past. </p><p>Carbon dioxide emissions  thought to be the main contributor to climate change  have also been growing steadily because our transport use is growing faster than the energy efficiency of our vehicles. </p><p>There is no easy solution to these environmental problems. Much is already being done, but there is still a long way to go.</p></div>
<h2>How much do we travel?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Between 1990 and 2002, passenger travel increased in most European countries by 30%, and road and air travel have grown faster than other modes of transport.</li>
<li>Freight transport has also risen steeply, by 34% over the past decade.</li>
<li>Marine transport is responsible for a very large share of freight transport (three quarters of the total EU freight transport figure).</li>
<li>In the UK, Netherlands and Denmark, passenger cars are driven with an average of only 1.6 persons per car.</li>
<li>Train occupancies are generally low. In most European countries, less than 30% of the seats are generally occupied. Aircraft occupancy rates are much higher at around 60%.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How does transport affect the environment?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Petroleum-powered engines produce carbon dioxide (thought to be the main cause of climate change), nitrous oxides and fine particles which pollute the air, and sulphur oxides which contribute to acid rain.</li>
<li>Emission of air pollutants has been reduced in Europe by about a third over the past decade but evidence indicates that as many as 370,000 people die prematurely each year due to air pollution.</li>
<li>Greenhouse gas emissions from transport have increased by around 23% since 1990.</li>
<li>Maritime transport is responsible for 13% of the world's total transport greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
<li>Roads, railways and airports cut the land into small pieces, putting natural habitats at risk, so that many species die out. Wildlife and plants are also threatened by the accompanying air pollution, noise and light disturbances.</li>
<li>In the 1990s, about 10 hectares a day were taken for motorway construction alone.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is being done?</h2>
<ul>
<li>New emissions technologies are already being developed and marketed.</li>
<li>EU standards on emissions from vehicles may be made tighter.</li>
<li>Standards on aircraft emissions could be applied to cruising at altitude, and a fuel tax could be introduced for intra-EU flights.</li>
<li>Biofuels will be improved and used more widely. (At present, biofuels make up less than 1% of total road transport fuel consumption.)</li>
<li>A higher proportion of transport use could be shifted from road to rail.</li>
<li>Better town planning could help to ensure that homes are closer to shops and places of work.</li>
<li>Charging could be applied to reflect the true environmental cost. (In Sweden, the environmental performance of ships determines the price for the use of certain sea routes.)</li>
<li>Vehicle taxes could be aligned to environmental performance.</li>
<li>Car-sharing lanes could be introduced more widely.</li>
<li>City bicycle lanes and networks could be improved. (A project in Odense, Denmark, developed 50 pro-cycling initiatives, including physical improvements of bicycle infrastructure, changes in regulations and awareness campaigns. During the project period, the citizens of Odense made about 25,000 new cycle journeys per day, half of which were previously made by car.)</li>
<li>Public transport could be improved. (Thirty years ago, the city of Curitiba in Brazil constructed a low-cost alternative to a metro system involving bus lanes, elevated covered platforms for loading and unloading and short intervals between buses. Now around 70% of commuters use the bus system every day.)</li>

<li>Car-sharing lanes could be introduced more widely.</li>
<li>City bicycle lanes and networks could be improved. (A project in Odense, Denmark, developed 50 pro-cycling initiatives, including physical improvements of bicycle infrastructure, changes in regulations and awareness campaigns. During the project period, the citizens of Odense made about 25,000 new cycle journeys per day, half of which were previously made by car.)</li>
<li>Public transport could be improved. (Thirty years ago, the city of Curitiba in Brazil constructed a low-cost alternative to a metro system involving bus lanes, elevated covered platforms for loading and unloading and short intervals between buses. Now around 70% of commuters use the bus system every day.)</li>

</div>

<p>We need fast, flexible transport for our economies to flourish and to maintain our high standard of living. Yet our ever-increasing demand for mobility pollutes the air and adds to the volume of greenhouse gases (GHGs) which are thought to be the main cause of climate change. </p><p>Roads and railways cut natural and agricultural areas into ever smaller pieces, threatening the existence of our wildlife and plants. High levels of traffic noise affect human health. And more than a hundred people die on the EUs roads every day. Much has already been done to address the transport dilemma, but there is no simple solution. Fuel and vehicles have both become cleaner over the past decade, but because means of transport are being used more often and over longer distances than in the past, the overall situation as regards air pollution is only improving slowly and, in the case of GHG emissions from transport, is actually getting worse.</p></div>
<h2>In love with travel</h2>
<p>Transport users are locked into consumption patterns that are not easily changed in the short term and which are the result of decades of planned and unplanned developments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Between 1990 and 2002, the average passenger travel distance increased in European countries by 30%, and road and air travel have grown faster than other modes of transport. The motorway and high speed rail networks have increased rapidly, while the conventional rail and inland waterways infrastructures have slowly shrunk. </p>
<p class="source">Transport and environment: TERM 2005, EEA report</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Traditionally, transport growth parallels economic growth. Research shows that people are willing to spend a fixed share of their income and time on transport, so the increase in travel is directly linked to the fact that earnings have risen.  Private cars are expensive to buy but generally cheaper to run than taking public transport, and the higher speeds of most forms of transport mean that we can travel further in less time. </p><p>The increase in air travel is due partly to the rise of low-cost air travel in Europe, where a plane ticket can cost as little as a visit to the theatre. Badly thought out urban planning is another reason for the rise in travel kilometres. </p><p>Over the last century, cars and roads have played a leading role in transforming society. Shopping has, to a large extent, moved to supermarkets and shopping malls, and workers have relocated to live further from their place of employment. The result has been an increasing reliance on transport for many daily tasks. </p><p>The shift of basic services from residential areas to the outskirts of major cities, coupled with the decline in public transport, has led to a reduction in neighbourhood quality of life.  People who have no car are disadvantaged by being less mobile and having fewer choices about where to live and work.</p>
<h2>The transport of goods</h2>
<p>Freight transport has also risen steeply, by 34% over the past decade. More goods are carried over longer distances and more frequently than ever before.  Again, this is partly a result of growing incomes which enable people to consume more, which in turn increases transport demand. </p><p>The distances between consumers and producers have grown, facilitated by the removal of barriers to trade in the internal market and globally. A familiar example of this is supermarkets being able to offer fresh produce from all corners of the world.In manufacturing, components are made and assembled in more than one location, because low transport costs allow companies to benefit from lower labour costs and particular skills in different regions. Lorries and vans are generally faster, cheaper, more reliable and more flexible than rail and inland waterway transport, so smaller but more frequent loads can be delivered exactly when needed. This tendency to 'just in time' deliveries has been reinforced by the high property prices in city centres which make it expensive to store large quantities of goods. </p><p>Marine transport is responsible for a very large share of freight transport - three quarters of the total EU freight transport figure. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sea transport for the EU-15 (2003) amounts to nearly 7 trillion tonne-km. This figure dwarfs the 1.7 trillion tonne-km performance of road, rail and inland waterways combined.</p>
<p class="source">Transport and environment: TERM 2005, EEA report</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These figures have particular significance, as shipping obviously takes place mainly on the high seas where emission regulations are less stringent.</p>
<h2>The impact on health and climate</h2>
<p>Motorised transport is one of the most important sources of harmful emissions, and the biggest consumer of oil. The combustion of fossil fuels in engines produces, amongst others:</p>
<ul>
<li>carbon dioxide, the GHG considered to be the main cause of climate change</li>
<li>nitrous oxides and particulate matter, which pollute the air</li>
<li>sulphur oxides, which contribute to acid rain that damages buildings and contaminates lakes, rivers, crops and trees</li>
<li>ground level ozone, which causes respiratory problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Emission of air pollutants has been significantly reduced in Europe over the past decade - by around a third. Yet in spite of this, we are still faced with air quality problems. The air quality limits which have been set for particulate matter have not been met in many cities, and ozone incidents are frequent. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is growing evidence to show that the effect that fine particles have on health has been underestimated, and that as many as 370,000 people die prematurely each year due to air pollution from particulate matter, nitrous oxides and ozone.</p>
<p class="source">Transport and environment: TERM 2005, EEA report</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As regards GHGs, all EU Member States have committed themselves to reducing emissions in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol. In the case of industry they have been substantially reduced, but GHG emissions from transport have increased by around 23% since 1990. So the reduction in emissions from industry has to a large extent been offset, making it more difficult for countries to meet the Kyoto targets. </p><p>Developed countries will need to reduce emissions by up to 80% by 2050 if we are to maintain a global temperature below the 2°C increase threshold set by EU ministers. So if transport emissions do not reduce from todays level (around 20%) they would consume our total quota by 2050. Acidifying emissions from transport have decreased by 34% since 2003, mainly due to innovations in exhaust gas treatment in road vehicles and improvements in fuel quality.  </p>
<h2>Transport and the countryside</h2>
<p>Transport infrastructure puts pressure on natural habitats and biodiversity through the direct use of land, disturbances from noise and light, air pollution and the breaking up of landscapes. </p><p>It is in the most highly populated areas that land is cut into the smallest fragments by airports, road and rail networks, and is therefore greatest in western and central Europe. The landscape here has been extremely fragmented for a long time and many species disappeared long ago. In the remote and less fragmented areas such as Arctic Europe, fragmentation is growing because of the increase in transport construction, and this is having a serious impact on biodiversity. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Roads consume approximately 90% of the total area of land used for transport in Europe. In the 1990s, about 10 hectares a day were taken for motorway construction alone.  </p>
<p class="source">Transport and environment: TERM 2005, EEA report</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As transport infrastructure expands, more and more designated nature areas will come under pressure. About half in Europe are already affected. </p>
<h2>Pressure on natural resources</h2>
<p>The world's energy needs are predicted to be almost 60% higher in 2030 than today. Transport relies on oil for more than 98% of its energy consumption, and is therefore very vulnerable to the shrinking of supplies. </p><p>Experts disagree on the exact timing of the worlds oil production peak, but agree that it is most likely to happen within the next 25 years. When it does happen, a number of alternative options to energy saving and renewable energy (such as producing synthetic fuels from natural gas, coal or oil-sand) will become more economically viable than they currently are. However, the life-cycle emissions of GHGs of these alternatives are generally higher than conventional fuels, and so will represent an additional burden on the environment.</p>

<h2>What is being done</h2>
<p>There is no single solution to the problem of transports various impacts on the environment.  In the short term, measures like improvements of logistics and better use of more efficient vehicles can reduce transport usage considerably. But in the long run consumption patterns will also have to be addressed. </p><p>Shifting a higher proportion of transport use from road to rail is seen as a good thing, because trains are generally more environmentally friendly than lorries and cars. However, specific measures such as building new rail infrastructure may in some cases boost rail transport without decreasing transport by road because the new infrastructure does not meet the needs of present road transport users. </p><p>Better vehicle technology is another way forward. The new emission abatement technologies (such as particle filters, exhaust gas recirculation and selective catalytic reduction) have the potential to reduce radically the emissions of nitrous oxides and particles in road and rail transport, and inland and sea shipping.</p>

<p>Aligning the environmental performance of vehicles to charges and taxes is one option that is being discussed and in some cases implemented.  In Sweden, for example, the environmental performance of ships determines the price for the use of certain sea routes. However, charges can have unwelcome side effects. </p><p>Many motorways in the EU are tolled for financing reasons but with little or no reflection of environmental performance in the charge structure. If these are included in the charge, and charging schemes are not extended to all roads, traffic could just be diverted away from main roads to minor ones. </p>

<p>One way to reduce GHG emissions is by using lower net carbon fuels such as biofuels, one of the few alternatives to petrol and diesel. These are made from biomass, which absorbs carbon while growing, so biofuels represent a lower carbon route to transport fuels. Unfortunately, however, harmful substances can be emitted during the tilling, harvesting and fertilising of the biomass. </p><p>Biofuels also require large areas of land for production and compete with other land uses (such as extensive farming or forestation) and other uses of biomass, such as fuel for heat and power plants. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>At present, biofuels make up less than 1% of total road transport fuel consumption, while petrol and diesel cover 98%. (The remaining 1% is mostly covered by gas).</p>

<h2>The way forward</h2>
<p>Moving towards a more sustainable transport system will require an integrated approach by policy-makers. Problems will need to be considered well in advance and not just tackled at the end-of-pipe phase via regulations relating to emissions. </p><p>Long-term measures will be required across many areas of policy and, if they are to be successful, must take into account not only the direct environmental impact but also what the impact will be on transport demand. </p>

					The European economy is based on a high level of resource consumption. This includes raw materials (such as metals, construction minerals or wood), energy and land. The main driving forces of Europe's resource consumption are economic growth, technological developments and changing consumption and production patterns. About one third of resources used are turned into waste and emissions. Around four tonnes of waste per capita are generated every year in the EEA member countries. Every European citizen on average throws away 520 kg of household waste per year, and this figure is expected to increase.

<p>In the EU-15, use of materials has changed little over the past two decades, and remains at about 15–16 tonnes per capita per year. However, this number varies considerably from country to country, from some 12 tonnes per capita in Italy to 38 tonnes per capita in Finland. Construction materials have the largest share in this, followed by fossil fuels and biomass. Efficiency of resource use is several times higher in the EU-15 than in the new EU&amp;nbsp;Member States&amp;nbsp;or the countries of South-eastern Europe. Projections to 2020 indicate that resource use in the EU will continue to increase.</p>
<p>Resource use is also increasing in other regions of the world. This is partly due to increased consumption of goods and services in Europe, often based on resources extracted from these other regions.</p>
<div>
<p><em>The EU aims to 'improve resource efficiency to reduce the overall use of non-renewable natural resources and the related environmental impacts of raw materials use, thereby using renewable natural resources at a rate that does not exceed their regeneration capacity'&amp;nbsp; </em>(Renewed <a href="http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/06/st10/st10117.en06.pdf">EU Sustainable Development Strategy</a>, 2006).</p>
</div>
<p>Europe's high resource consumption puts pressure on the environment both within Europe and in other regions of the world. These pressures include depletion of non-renewable resources, intensive use of renewable resources, transportation, high emissions to water, air and soil from mining activities as well as production, consumption and waste generation. It is generally accepted that there are physical limits to the continued growth of resource use. Housing, food and mobility account for the largest share of resource use and environmental pressures.</p>
<p>Waste disposal has the potential to cause a number of impacts on health and the environment, including emissions to air, surface water and groundwater, depending on how it is managed. Waste also represents a loss of natural resources (such as the metals or other recyclable materials it contains, or its potential as an energy source). Therefore, sound management of waste can protect public health and the quality of the environment whilst supporting conservation of natural resources.</p>
<p>The largest waste streams in Europe&amp;nbsp;originate from construction and demolition, along with manufacturing activities. Most EU municipal waste is still sent to landfill (45&amp;nbsp;%). However, more and more municipal waste is recycled or composted (37&amp;nbsp;%), or incinerated with energy recovery (18&amp;nbsp;%).</p>

<p>Almost every European Community policy affects the use and management of natural resources. Among the most important are the common agricultural policy, the common fisheries policy, the regional development policy, and the transport and energy policies. A number of cross-cutting environmental strategies address the sustainable use and management of resources, including the <a href="http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/06/st10/st10117.en06.pdf">Sustainable Development Strategy</a>, the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/newprg/index.htm">6th environment action programme</a>, and the 2005 thematic strategies on the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52005DC0666:EN:NOT">prevention and recycling of waste</a> and on the <a class="external-link" href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/natres/pdf/com_natres_en.pdf">sustainable use of natural resources</a>.</p>
<p>The ongoing policy debate shows the need for better integration of environment- and resource-related considerations into sectoral and other policy areas. Some of the questions outstanding revolve around how to estimate the environmental impacts of resource use, what priority areas or specific resources should be the focus of policy intervention, and how to set targets and measure progress in sustainable use and management of resources.</p>
<p>As gains in technical efficiency are often offset by more widespread consumption, it is unlikely that resource use and waste generation can be reduced by technological improvements alone. The sustainability of current lifestyles and <a title="Household consumption" class="internal-link" href="resolveuid/9f34dfee8260349f0038d73e551f32f8">consumption</a>&amp;nbsp;patterns may have to be critically reviewed and technology has to be combined with other <a title="About policy instruments" class="internal-link" href="resolveuid/5e63ef914329a19a6136a71b9827cafe">policy instruments</a>.&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Whereas EU policies on resources are still evolving, waste policies both in the EU and in individual EU Member States have been progressively put in place since the 1970s. The EU's current waste policy is based on the 'waste hierarchy'. This first aims at waste prevention, then at reducing waste disposal through re-use, recycling and other waste recovery operations. This hierarchy is likely to be strengthened by the amended <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32006L0012:EN:NOT">Waste Framework Directive</a> currently under revision, and by the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52005DC0666:EN:NOT">thematic strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste</a>.</p>
<p>The main waste treatment activities are regulated by the <a class="external-link" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31999L0031:EN:NOT">Landfill Directive</a>, the <a class="external-link" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0076:EN:NOT">Waste Incineration Directive</a> and the <a class="external-link" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32008L0001:EN:NOT">IPPC Directive</a>. For some special waste streams such as packaging waste, end-of-life vehicles and waste electrical and electronic equipment, the principle of the waste hierarchy has been transformed, for example by the introduction of concrete targets for recycling.</p>
<p>A <a class="external-link" href="http://glossary.eea.europa.eu/terminology/concept_html?term=life%20cycle">life-cycle</a> approach in policy-making ensures that impacts are assessed from cradle to grave, and that environmental impacts are not simply hidden by moving them to different countries or different stages of production or consumption.</p>

<ul><li>periodic assessments and <a href="resolveuid/8f67ff52fd3e5b9b94f61f314f44b07f">reports</a> on waste and material flows such as the pan-European review <a href="http://reports.eea.europa.eu/state_of_environment_report_2007_1/en/chapter6.pdf">Europe's environment&amp;nbsp;— the fourth assessment</a>;</li><li><a href="http://reports.eea.europa.eu/eea_report_2007_3/en">regional overviews</a> of implementation of sustainable consumption and production, and of waste generation and resource use in particular;</li><li>support to specific policy priorities, including <a href="http://reports.eea.europa.eu/eea_report_2005_9/en">sustainable use and management of natural resources</a> and the decoupling of economic growth from <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/natres/pdf/zero_study_final.pdf">resource use</a> and waste;</li><li>support to member countries in <a href="http://rod.eionet.europa.eu/index.html">waste reporting</a> (including the Packaging Waste Directive) and material flow accounting;</li><li>policy effectiveness studies, e.g. packaging waste management, urban wastewater treatment systems, diversion of waste from landfills, use of economic instruments in resource management; see also <a title="About policy instruments" class="internal-link" href="resolveuid/5e63ef914329a19a6136a71b9827cafe">Policy instruments</a>.</li><li>work on trans-boundary shipments of waste in Europe and the environmental effects of the 'recycling society';</li><li>future outlooks and scenarios studies, such as on the development of waste generation and its environmental impacts;</li><li><a href="resolveuid/ae7d24dac8e8b4f46249cfa70959a0eb">indicators on municipal waste generation and generation and recycling of packaging waste</a>;</li><li><a href="http://waste.eionet.europa.eu/etcwmf/publications/factsheet">country fact sheets on waste management in EU Member States</a>;</li><li>an inventory of waste management companies, knowledge centres and installations in the <a href="http://technologies.ew.eea.europa.eu/atlas_map">European Environmental Technology Atlas</a>.</li></ul>
<p>The EEA's sustainable consumption and production group leads the EEA work on waste and material resources. Activities are implemented through cooperation with the EEA's European Topic Centre on Resource and Waste Management (<a href="http://waste.eionet.europa.eu/etcwmf/organisation/index_html?sort_on=organisation">ETC/RWM</a>) and in collaboration with EEA's country network (<a href="http://eionet.europa.eu/">Eionet</a>).&amp;nbsp;Eurostat is collecting waste <a href="http://europa.eu.int/estatref/info/sdds/en/env/env_base.htm">data</a>,&amp;nbsp;and from 2008 it will host the environmental data centres on resources, products and waste.</p>

InsertUpdate|FAQ|Item6|en-GB|{"Order": 6,"Title":"Are E-PRTR data complete and comparable?","Content":"<p>All parties involved (operators, competent authorities, national authorities, the European Commission and the European Environment Agency) strive to achieve the highest possible degree of completeness and comparability when reporting and processing E-PRTR data. E-PRTR covers data reported by many countries and collected from a wide range of sectors of activity and more than 28 000 individual sources of data. The complexity of this exercise puts some boundaries on the completeness and comparability of the data and the first E-PRTR collection of data has required considerable efforts from all parties involved to prevent and correct errors and omissions.</p><p>The E-PRTR data on total annual releases and transfers do not provide for direct comparisons of individual facilities' environmental performance because large facilities with good environmental performance can have higher annual releases than much smaller facilities performing poorly. Between sectors, the variety of production processes and products manufactured has also to be considered when making comparisons. Under E-PRTR, operators are not required to report 'activity data' (for instance on production volume or energy consumption) although this information can be provided on a voluntary basis.</p><p>In addition, different techniques are used to determine releases and transfers in different countries, thus creating differing levels of uncertainty.

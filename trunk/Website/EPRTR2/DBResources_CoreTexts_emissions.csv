InsertUpdate|DiffuseSources|WATER_FLUORANTHENE_InlandNavigation.GeneralInformation|en-GB|<p>The map shows fluoranthene emissions to surface water from inland navigation per River Basin District Subunit (RBDSU) level for the reference year 2011, for EU27 and EFTA countries with available data in 2013. Diffuse emissions of fluoranthene are expressed in load to surface water (kg/ha surface water) per RBDSU.</p>
InsertUpdate|DiffuseSources|WATER_FLUORANTHENE_InlandNavigation.Methodology|en-GB|<p>Diffuse emissions of fluoranthene to surface water from inland navigation were spatially allocated according to the spatial pattern of navigable inland waterways using georeferenced water course and shipping activity data. The national emissions were allocated to the RBDSU spatial level using GIS visualization techniques.</p><p>The emissions are calculated for inland vessels. Emissions are calculated by multiplying an activity rate (AR), in the case of inland navigation the number of ton-kilometres (tkm; a ton-kilometre is one ton of cargo transported one km across the water) traversed by all professional vessels on inland waters within European Union (EU27 + EFTA countries), by an emission factor (EF), expressed in emission per AR unit. The calculation method is shown in the formula below:</p><p>Es = AR x EF<br/>Where:<ul><li>Es = Emission of substance (pollutants) to surface waters</li><li>AR = Activity rate, in this case the traffic performance (distance covered on the EU inland surface waters in surface 106 tkm)</li><li>EF = Emission factor (kg/106 tkm)</li></ul><p>The emission calculated in this way is referred to as the total emission. Because all emissions are released directly into surface waters, the total emission equals the net emission to surface waters.</p>

InsertUpdate|DiffuseSources|WATER_P_Agriculture.Methodology|en-GB|<p>The nutrient emissions are calculated by the of the JRC's GREEN model. The GREEN (Geospatial Regression Equation for European Nutrient losses) is based on a simplified conceptual approach distinguishing the different pathways in which nutrients reach surface waters. According to this approach, diffuse sources, including fertiliser applications (both mineral and organic forms), scattered dwelling, atmospheric deposition, are first reduced in the soil matrix and then once in the stream they undergo further reduction due to in-stream retention processes, while point sources, which include waste water treatment plants, industrial effluents and runoff from paved areas, reach directly the streams and are thus reduced only by the stream retention process.  <br />In the model, the driver behind the nutrient losses is the annual precipitation and the retention in water is linked to the river length. <br />In this project only the Nutrient emissions of agricultural sources are used: the fertilizer applications. The application of mineral fertiliser and manure varies considerably across <br />European regions according to the production system, crop types, climatic conditions and soil characteristics. A reasonable estimation of fertiliser application at European level should consider these spatial variations. <br />The methodology applied and data used is described by Fayçal Bouraoui, Bruna Grizzetti and Alberto Aloe in <a href='http://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/111111111/8130/1/eur_fatescenario_baseline.pdf'>Nutrient discharge from rivers to seas for year 2000</a> (JRC Scientific and Technical Reports).

InsertUpdate|DiffuseSources|WATER_ZN_Transport.Methodology|en-GB|<p>Emissions of zinc to surface water from road transport were spatially allocated to the RBDSU level according to the data modelled by <a href='http://www.tremove.org/model/index.htm'>TREMOVE</a>, due to the road network derived from the TRANS-TOOLS model and GISCO data set. The traffic density information was derived also from the TRANS-TOOLS model runs. The split into highway, rural and urban activities have been derived from the <a href='http://www.tremove.org/model/index.htm'>TREMOVE model</a>. The emissions were allocated to the RBDSU spatial level using GIS visualization techniques. <br /> The emissions are calculated separately for various vehicle categories (light and heavy) and road types (urban, rural and highways). Pollutants emitted on urban roads are not incorporated in the calculated emissions to surface water, see the section 'Activity rates' for an explanation. Emissions are calculated by multiplying an activity rate (AR), in the case of road traffic the mileages on roads in European Union (EU27) member states, by an emission factor (EF), expressed in emission per AR unit. The calculation method is shown in the formula below: <br />Es = AR * EF * pathway<br />Where: <ul><li>Es = Emission of substance (pollutant) s to compartments (soil, surface water and sewers)</li><il>AR = Activity Rate, in this case the traffic performance (distance covered on the EU road network in 106 km)</li><li>EF= Emission Factor (kg/106 km)</li><li>Pathway = Percentage of the emission allocated to compartment x</li></ul>The emission calculated in this way is referred to as the total emission. A specific proportion of this total emission ends up in surface water: This is defined as the net emission to the surface water.</p>
